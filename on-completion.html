    <h1>The Desire for Completion</h1>
    <h2>Ontology, Logic, and the Limits of Definition</h2>

    <p>
        From philosophy to formal systems,
        from Gödel to artificial intelligence,
        this series follows a single word
        we have never stopped using—
        <strong>“completion.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Not as a statement of truth,
        but as a decision.
        <br />
        Not as an end,
        but as a way to continue working
        despite knowing that the end
        can never be reached.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a defense of ontology,
        nor an attack on it.
        <br />
        It is a record of following
        one persistent doubt
        to its limit.

    <h1>Preface</h1>
    <h2>— When the Word “Completion” Began to Sound Strange</h2>

    <p>
        The first time I heard the phrase <strong>“Ontology Completion,”</strong>
        what unsettled me was not that I failed to understand a technical term,
        but that the expression was used with such disarming naturalness.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Completion.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Completion of what, to what extent, and by which criteria?
    </p>

    <p>
        These questions are usually treated as insignificant.
        Ontologies, we are told, are bounded by domains;
        completion is merely a practical concern;
        to invoke philosophical implications is considered excessive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet it was precisely this point that troubled me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Humanity has already experienced, once before,
        what happens when the word <em>“completion”</em> is taken seriously—
        and has suffered a logical defeat because of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the early twentieth century,
        Russell and Whitehead attempted to complete all of mathematics through logic.
        Their ambition was not excessive;
        it was, in fact, the most intellectually honest aspiration of their time.
    </p>

    <p>
        And Gödel proved that this ambition did not fail because it was naïve or insufficient,
        but because it succeeded.
    </p>

    <p>
        Completion did not collapse from the outside;
        it imploded from within.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that moment, philosophy split.
        One path began to doubt systems themselves.
        The other, rather than abandoning totality altogether,
        chose to refine individual sentences, individual rules,
        with extreme precision.
    </p>

    <p>
        What we now call <strong>analytic philosophy</strong>
        is, in fact, the outcome of that choice.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is not a philosophy that denied completion,
        but one that succeeded in narrowing its scope.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that philosophy flowed, almost seamlessly,
        into computer science.
    </p>

    <p>
        Which is why this question cannot be avoided:
    </p>

    <p>
        Is <strong>ontology completion</strong>
        truly a state of knowledge?
    </p>

    <p>
        Or is it a language devised to allow work to continue,
        even after we already know that completion is impossible?
    </p>

    <p>
        These texts begin with that question.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are not an attempt to deny ontologies,
        nor to attack AI or formal logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rather, they seek—at least once—
        to follow to the end the word we use too casually:
        <em>“completion.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        To ask when, why, and in what sense it managed to survive.
    </p>

    <p>
        This series does not promise conclusions.
        It is closer to a record of pursuing a single doubt to its limit.
    </p>

    <p>
        We already know that completion is not possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, we continue to speak of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this question no longer feels trivial to you,
        you will already read these words to the end.
    </p>

    <h1>Part I</h1>
    <h2>Why Do We Want to Speak of “Completion”</h2>
    <h3>— The Desire Called Ontology Completion</h3>

    <p>
        The word <em>“completion”</em> is a strange one.
    </p>

    <p>
        It feels especially strange when encountered in technical documents.
    </p>

    <p>
        Systems expand, requirements change,
        domains are always partial and provisional—
        and yet, in the midst of all this, we often say:
        <em>“This ontology is now complete.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        This sentence does not report a fact.
        It is closer to a declaration of attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a technical perspective,
        <strong>ontology completion</strong> usually has a fairly modest meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are no missing concepts that block inference;
        the rules are closed;
        and for any given query, the system can respond without stalling.
    </p>

    <p>
        In short, it means <em>“sufficiently defined.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem begins here.
    </p>

    <p>
        Between saying <em>“it is sufficient”</em>
        and saying <em>“it is complete,”</em>
        there is a leap that logic does not require.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why do we not simply say “sufficient”?
        Why insist on saying “complete”?
    </p>

    <p>
        This question points beyond the technical domain.
    </p>

    <p>
        The word <em>completion</em> functions as a form of permission:
        permission to stop touching the system,
        a declaration that the current state may serve as a reference point,
        and above all, a spell that temporarily pushes uncertainty aside.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is not a word used for systems,
        but for human reassurance.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is striking is that the word <em>completion</em>
        appears most frequently in fields that are,
        by their nature, premised on incompleteness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Software never stops updating.
        Data is always insufficient.
        Any attempt to model the world
        is inevitably smaller than the world itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, we continue to invoke the word <em>“completion.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not so much a misunderstanding born of ignorance
        as it is a choice repeated with full awareness.
    </p>

    <p>
        The word <em>completion</em> carries an implicit promise:
    </p>

    <p>
        What has been defined here
        will no longer be questioned.
    </p>

    <p>
        This promise is powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
        It halts questions,
        closes discussion,
        and allows us to move on
        to the phase of calculation and application.
    </p>

    <p>
        What ontology completion actually accomplishes
        is not a final declaration about what exists,
        but a signal that the phase of work has shifted.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is why ontology completion
        is less a metaphysical claim
        than an operational decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        “This should be enough.”
        <br />
        “Let’s put it into operation.”
        <br />
        “If we dig any deeper, the schedule collapses.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The word <em>completion</em>
        is the refinement of all these statements
        into a single term.
    </p>

    <p>
        But it is precisely here
        that discomfort arises.
    </p>

    <p>
        The word <em>ontology</em>
        originally belonged to philosophy—
        a language for speaking about being.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the word <em>completion</em>
        implies that no further questions about that being remain.
    </p>

    <p>
        The moment the two are combined,
        a technical decision begins to take on ontological authority.
    </p>

    <p>
        It no longer sounds like
        “this is how we have defined it,”
        but rather,
        “this is how it exists.”
    </p>

    <p>
        What this series calls into question
        is not the act of constructing ontologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        That act is unavoidable,
        and often useful.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem lies in the name we give to that act.
    </p>

    <p>
        The word <em>completion</em>
        does not describe a state of knowledge
        so much as it reveals a way of managing anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do not stop because we know the world completely;
        we declare that we are stopping
        because we no longer wish to remain unsettled.
    </p>

    <p>
        This declaration does not fail—
        because it was never aimed at truth to begin with.
    </p>

    <p>
        Completion is not a fact.
        It is a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that decision
        has already once led humanity
        into a vast experiment in thought.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will look back to a time
        long before ontology became a technical term,
        to trace where this ancient obsession
        with classifying being began.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beginning with the question of why,
        when faced with the world,
        we so persistently feel the desire
        to <em>put things in order</em>.
    </p>

<section id="part-2-ontology-as-philosophy">
    <h1>Part II</h1>
    <h2>Ontology Was Originally Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>— Humanity’s Long Obsession with Classifying Being</h3>

    <p>
        Ontology was not, to begin with, a technical term.
    </p>

    <p>
        Long before the word <em>technology</em> itself existed,
        humans were already asking ontological questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        What exists?
        <br />
        And by what criteria can those things be distinguished?
    </p>

    <p>
        These were not questions of idle curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to survive, to judge,
        and to render the world intelligible,
        humans had to divide something from something else.
    </p>

    <p>
        In ancient Greece, philosophy was,
        before it was a theory of the world,
        a technique of ordering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aristotle’s categories were not ornaments
        designed to decorate explanations of being.
        They were tools for enduring confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is this a substance or an attribute?
        <br />
        A particular or a universal?
        <br />
        Accidental or essential?
    </p>

    <p>
        These distinctions were less a claim that
        “the world truly is structured this way”
        than a confession that
        without such divisions, thinking itself was impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        What matters here is that
        in these early forms of ontology,
        the concept of <em>completion</em> is largely absent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being was classified,
        but those classifications were always provisional.
    </p>

    <p>
        Philosophy after Aristotle
        refined or revised his categories,
        but it never declared,
        “This is finished.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology was not a closed system,
        but something closer to a map
        continuously amended and extended.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the arrival of the medieval period,
        ontology became intertwined with theology.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, being was no longer understood
        merely as that which exists,
        but as that which is created,
        ordered,
        and placed within a hierarchy.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is at this moment that
        the idea of a <em>complete inventory of being</em>
        first begins to appear.
    </p>

    <p>
        God knows everything.
        Everything already has its assigned place.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet paradoxically,
        this completion did not belong to humans.
    </p>

    <p>
        Human ontology remained incomplete,
        and under the shadow of divine completion,
        it was required to remain humble.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the advent of modernity,
        the situation changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the place of God is emptied,
        something else must step in to occupy it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reason.
    </p>

    <p>
        Philosophy after Descartes
        constructs an ontology not around the world itself,
        but around the knowing subject.
    </p>

    <p>
        What exists becomes less important than
        what can be stated with certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being is no longer merely classified;
        it becomes something that must be proven.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point,
        ontology quietly changes its goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        It moves from the task of listing the world
        to the task of grounding the world completely.
    </p>

    <p>
        This shift creates the conditions
        under which the word <em>completion</em>
        can later appear as something natural.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being is no longer treated as an open question,
        but as a list that could, in principle,
        be fully reached—given sufficient method.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within philosophy itself, however,
        this belief does not last long.
    </p>

    <p>
        Any criterion for classifying being
        always presupposes another criterion,
        which in turn demands explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology increasingly reveals
        that it cannot justify itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Classification was necessary,
        but final classification was impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet,
        this ancient obsession does not disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, it changes form.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attempts to classify the whole world
        become too large and too dangerous,
        and so they retreat
        into smaller, safer territories.
    </p>

    <p>
        Domains.
        <br />
        Formal systems.
        <br />
        Closed languages.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology withdraws from the world
        and enters the system.
    </p>

    <p>
        This movement is not a defeat,
        but a strategic retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even while accepting
        that the whole cannot be spoken,
        there still must be places
        where order is possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        And it is precisely at this point
        that ontology leaves philosophy
        and moves toward logic and mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will examine the moment
        when this movement appeared
        in its most optimistic form:
        the attempt of Russell and Whitehead.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why they believed,
        “This time, it really is possible,”
        and why that belief
        remains the most refined failure of all.

        Russell and Whitehead did not look away from this anxiety.
        They confronted it directly.
    </p>

    <p>
        For them, the problem lay not in calculation,
        but in foundations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their goal was clear:
    </p>

    <p>
        To reduce all of mathematics to logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Numbers, sets, functions, proofs—
        all of these, they believed,
        could be rigorously derived
        from a small number of logical axioms and rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this were possible,
        mathematics would no longer tremble.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Principia Mathematica</em>
        was the product of this ambition.
    </p>

    <p>
        This attempt was not reckless.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the standards of the time,
        it was the most conservative
        and the most thorough option available.
    </p>

    <p>
        Intuition was excluded.
        Self-evidence was treated with suspicion.
        Every step was written out explicitly.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason it took hundreds of pages
        to prove that <em>1 + 1 = 2</em>
        was not exaggeration,
        but a refusal to take anything for granted.
    </p>

    <p>
        What Russell and Whitehead believed in
        was not completion,
        but grounding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the foundations were perfectly secured,
        everything built upon them
        would follow mechanically.
    </p>

    <p>
        This belief touches a kind of ontological optimism:
    </p>

    <p>
        the conviction that being,
        once translated into a sufficiently well-defined language,
        would no longer waver.
    </p>

    <p>
        What matters is that
        this optimism did not arise from naivety.
    </p>

    <p>
        Russell already knew,
        through his own paradox,
        how easily a system could collapse.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, he did not flee.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, he pushed the paradox
        into the system itself,
        constructing the more refined apparatus
        of type theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        A stance that acknowledges failure
        without surrendering.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Principia Mathematica</em>
        achieved a great deal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The refinement of logical notation.
        <br />
        The establishment of standards for formal proof.
        <br />
        The entrenchment of the attitude
        that everything must be stated explicitly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Much of what we now take for granted
        in formal logic and programming languages
        traces back to this work.
    </p>

    <p>
        For that reason,
        this book is not a failure.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet,
        this attempt failed.
    </p>

    <p>
        More precisely,
        it failed because it succeeded.
    </p>

    <p>
        Russell and Whitehead
        pressed their own rules to the limit.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a result,
        what the system could do
        and what it could not do
        became all too clear.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Principia Mathematica</em>
        was not a complete system.
    </p>

    <p>
        But it became the stage
        on which the impossibility of completion
        was demonstrated
        with the greatest persuasiveness.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a system becomes sufficiently precise,
        its limits become precise as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Those limits are no longer voiced
        as external criticism,
        but are prepared to be spoken
        in the system’s own language.
    </p>

    <p>
        Onto this prepared stage,
        Gödel appears.
    </p>

    <p>
        He does not arrive
        bearing a new philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>
        He adds no new axioms.
    </p>

    <p>
        He simply uses the language
        Russell and Whitehead had constructed
        to say what that language itself
        could not say.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will examine this quiet but fatal turn:
    </p>

    <p>
        the fact that completion did not collapse
        from the outside,
        but imploded from within.
    </p>

    <p>
        A proof that required no new axioms
        to undo axioms themselves—
        Gödel’s moment.
    </p>

<section id="part-4-godel">
    <h1>Part IV</h1>
    <h2>Gödel: Completion Collapses from Within</h2>
    <h3>— A Proof That Undermined Axioms Without Adding Any</h3>

    <p>
        Gödel’s name is often summarized
        as that of “the man who showed
        that mathematics has limits.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But this description is too quick.
    </p>

    <p>
        What Gödel did
        was not to discover limits from the outside,
        but to follow—step by step—
        how a system already in operation
        betrays itself from within.
    </p>

    <p>
        He did not throw stones from the outside.
    </p>

    <p>
        He entered the system,
        spoke only in its language,
        and constructed a sentence
        that the language itself could not bear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem
        is technically complex,
        but its core is simple.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a formal system is
        sufficiently powerful,
        consistent,
        and capable of speaking about itself,
        then within that system
        there must exist a sentence
        that is true but unprovable.
    </p>

    <p>
        What matters
        is not merely that such a sentence
        cannot be proven,
        but that the system cannot exclude it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gödel constructed,
        within the system itself,
        the sentence:
        “This sentence cannot be proven.”
    </p>

    <p>
        If the sentence is proven,
        the system falls into contradiction.
    </p>

    <p>
        If it is not proven,
        the system must concede its incompleteness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Either way,
        completion is impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not an external attack.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a blank space
        the system leaves for itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a common misunderstanding here.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gödel did not leave us
        with the simple lesson
        that “we should just add more axioms.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Adding axioms
        may expand a system.
    </p>

    <p>
        But in that expanded system,
        the same problem reappears.
    </p>

    <p>
        Completion is merely postponed,
        never reached.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is why Gödel’s proof
        is so devastating.
    </p>

    <p>
        Incompleteness
        is not a temporary flaw,
        but a structural condition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The more powerful a system becomes,
        the more clearly it delineates
        what it cannot say.
    </p>

    <p>
        The closer one moves toward completion,
        the more precisely
        the impossibility of completion
        is demonstrated.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point,
        the attempt of Russell and Whitehead
        begins to look different.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their failure was not the result
        of excessive ambition,
        but the unavoidable outcome
        of pushing that ambition
        all the way through.
    </p>

    <p>
        The moment a system
        takes completion as its goal,
        it must explain itself completely.
    </p>

    <p>
        And at precisely that moment,
        something unexplainable
        inevitably remains.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Gödel,
        the word <em>completion</em>
        can no longer be used innocently.
    </p>

    <p>
        When someone speaks
        of a completed system,
        they mean one of two things.
    </p>

    <p>
        Either they have defined
        what completion means
        with extreme restriction,
    </p>

    <p>
        or they already know
        that completion is impossible,
        and are using the word
        for some other purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Philosophy after Gödel
        finds itself at this fork.
    </p>

    <p>
        One path says:
        “Then the very idea of a system
        must be the problem.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The other says:
        “Then let us say,
        with absolute precision,
        only what a system can say.”
    </p>

    <p>
        These two choices
        divide the course
        of twentieth-century philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will examine the second path—
    </p>

    <p>
        the road that abandons totality
        and chooses the sentence:
        the attitude of analytic philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why, even after Gödel,
        logic and formalism
        were not discarded.
    </p>

<section id="part-5-analytic-philosophy">
    <h1>Part V</h1>
    <h2>The Choice After Failure: Analytic Philosophy</h2>
    <h3>— Abandoning the Whole, Choosing the Sentence</h3>

    <p>
        Even after Gödel,
        logic and formalism did not disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
        This fact is often overlooked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even after the impossibility of completion was proven,
        people continued to use logic,
        to posit axioms,
        and to refine formal systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        This was not inertia.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was a deliberate choice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gödel’s theorems were not a declaration
        that “nothing can be done.”
    </p>

    <p>
        They merely stated
        that “the whole cannot be reached in this way.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And so the question changes:
    </p>

    <p>
        If the whole is impossible,
        what, then, can we do?
    </p>

    <p>
        Analytic philosophy is the tradition
        that answered this question
        with the greatest sobriety.
    </p>

    <p>
        At its core,
        analytic philosophy is a reduction of ambition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole world ❌
        <br />
        The whole of language ❌
        <br />
        The essence of meaning ❌
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead:
    </p>

    <p>
        When is this sentence true?
        <br />
        In which cases does this rule apply?
        <br />
        Under what conditions does this expression function?
    </p>

    <p>
        Completion was abandoned,
        but precision was not.
    </p>

    <p>
        Early Wittgenstein’s
        <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>
        is an extreme example of this attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
        The world is the totality of facts.
    </p>

    <p>
        What can be said
        must be said clearly.
    </p>

    <p>
        And of what cannot be spoken,
        one must remain silent.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the tension of the post-Gödel moment
        is condensed here.
    </p>

    <p>
        After failing to speak of the whole,
        the decision is made
        to clarify—without remainder—
        only what can be said.
    </p>

    <p>
        Analytic philosophy then moves
        toward ever smaller units.
    </p>

    <p>
        Semantics.
        <br />
        Syntax.
        <br />
        Logic.
        <br />
        Speech acts.
        <br />
        Reference.
        <br />
        Truth conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        These are less tools
        for revealing the essence of the world
        than devices for removing misunderstanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Analytic philosophy does not explain.
    </p>

    <p>
        It organizes.
    </p>

    <p>
        This attitude aligns
        with computer science
        to a surprising degree.
    </p>

    <p>
        Computers do not understand the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        They merely follow rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a sentence is ambiguous,
        computation halts.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a definition is missing,
        the system collapses.
    </p>

    <p>
        And so the language of analytic philosophy—
        formality,
        explicitness,
        closed rules—
        is naturally absorbed
        into computable languages.
    </p>

    <p>
        A crucial shift occurs here.
    </p>

    <p>
        For analytic philosophy,
        formalization was an attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
        For computer science,
        formalization is a condition.
    </p>

    <p>
        What in philosophy meant
        “let us speak this way”
        becomes, in engineering,
        “unless we speak this way,
        nothing works.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The philosophical strategy
        of abandoning completion
        ironically makes
        local completion possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        From this point on,
        the word <em>completion</em>
        returns with a different meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not the completion of the world,
        but the completion of a sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not the totality of being,
        but the closure of a domain.
    </p>

    <p>
        In ways analytic philosophy never intended—
        yet precisely because of its attitude—
        “completion” becomes speakable again.
    </p>

    <p>
        But this completion
        is no longer naïve.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is not a claim about the whole,
        nor a declaration of truth.
    </p>

    <p>
        It says only this:
    </p>

    <p>
        Within this language,
        under these rules,
        for this purpose,
        no further questions need be asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a philosophical statement,
        but an operational one.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will examine this very moment—
    </p>

    <p>
        the point at which
        the attitude of analytic philosophy
        hardens into the language of engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is ontology completion
        the heir of philosophy,
        or the most misunderstood legacy
        philosophy has left behind?
    </p>

    <p>
        Let us dissect it directly.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="part-6-ontology-completion">
    <h1>Part VI</h1>
    <h2>The Nature of Ontology Completion</h2>
    <h3>— The Language of Engineering, Not of Philosophy</h3>

    <p>
        The phrase <em>ontology completion</em>
        has a curiously neutral sound.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is neither excessive nor aggressive.
    </p>

    <p>
        And for that very reason,
        it is easily accepted.
    </p>

    <p>
        It appears as if it emerged naturally
        from purely technical necessity,
        untouched by long-standing philosophical disputes.
    </p>

    <p>
        But this term is not so pure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology completion
        is not a discovery,
        but a declaration of state.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not “this ontology is true,”
        but “this ontology is now sufficiently defined.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And the criterion of sufficiency here
        does not come from the world,
        but from the requirements of the system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Does inference terminate?
        <br />
        Are there unresolved exceptions?
        <br />
        Does the system always respond to queries?
    </p>

    <p>
        When these questions
        can be answered with “yes,”
        we say that the ontology is complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point,
        a crucial assumption is silently adopted:
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>Closed World Assumption</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is not stated
        is treated as non-existent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Philosophically,
        this is an extremely strong claim.
    </p>

    <p>
        Engineering-wise,
        without it,
        the system simply does not function.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology completion
        is the procedure
        by which this assumption is formalized.
    </p>

    <p>
        What matters is that
        completion here
        is entirely independent of truth conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        A completed ontology
        can be wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        It can be incomplete.
    </p>

    <p>
        It may even diverge from reality.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet,
        it is still called complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because the goal is not understanding,
        but computation.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is at this point
        that philosophy and engineering
        decisively diverge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Philosophy asks:
        <br />
        Does this really exist?
        <br />
        Is this classification justified?
    </p>

    <p>
        Engineering asks:
        <br />
        Does the system terminate?
        <br />
        Can we proceed to the next step?
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology completion
        is an answer to the latter.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this reason,
        ontology completion is less
        an extension of philosophical ontology
        than the result of converting
        the attitude of analytic philosophy
        into operational rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        It eliminates ambiguity,
        closes definitions,
        and forbids exceptions.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a language for speaking about being,
        but a language for finishing work.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem is that
        this language works too well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Declaring completion
        halts discussion,
        enables deployment,
        and draws boundaries of responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Any problems beyond this point
        are no longer problems of the ontology.”
    </p>

    <p>
        This sentence is
        technically legitimate,
        but philosophically heavy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology completion feels unsettling
        not because it imitates philosophy,
        but because it reuses,
        without explanation,
        a word philosophy had already abandoned.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Gödel,
        the word <em>completion</em>
        was something to be handled with care.
    </p>

    <p>
        Engineering, however,
        redefines the word
        for a different purpose,
        and then uses it
        as if nothing had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
        This reuse is not deception.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a choice made out of necessity.
    </p>

    <p>
        But every choice
        comes with a cost.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology completion
        does not tell us
        what we have given up.
    </p>

    <p>
        It foregrounds only one fact:
        that the system works.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will examine
        what kinds of fractures appear
        when this language encounters AI.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why artificial intelligence,
        which began with the languages
        of analysis and formalization,
        increasingly turns
        toward ways of handling meaning
        outside formal systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        And whether,
        by drawing every leaf perfectly,
        the forest truly comes into view.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="part-7-ai-and-analysis">
    <h1>Part VII</h1>
    <h2>The Arrival of AI: Was Analysis Really the Answer?</h2>
    <h3>— If Every Leaf Is Drawn Perfectly, Does the Forest Appear?</h3>

    <p>
        For a long time,
        analytic philosophy and engineering
        were looking in the same direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remove ambiguity.
        Make definitions explicit.
        Close the rules—
        and meaning will follow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Early artificial intelligence
        inherited this belief almost intact.
    </p>

    <p>
        The world could be represented in symbols.
        Symbols could be manipulated by rules.
        And with a sufficiently refined ontology,
        intelligence could be implemented.
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach was reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
        And it achieved real results.
    </p>

    <p>
        Expert systems.
        <br />
        Knowledge-based reasoning.
        <br />
        Rule engines.
        <br />
        Ontology-centered knowledge representation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, intelligence was measured
        not by understanding,
        but by application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Correct classification.
        <br />
        Consistent inference.
        <br />
        Predictable behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet the same problems
        followed this approach everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        As ontologies grew,
        maintenance costs exploded.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the world shifted even slightly,
        rules quickly became obsolete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of all,
        the meanings people actually used
        constantly crossed
        the boundaries of ontologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Analysis became more refined,
        but intelligence did not grow
        as well as expected.
    </p>

    <p>
        The turning point arrived
        in an unexpected form.
    </p>

    <p>
        Models that relied on statistics—
        later, deep learning
        and large language models—
        did not begin
        by constructing ontologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        They did not classify being.
        They did not define meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead,
        they absorbed patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach is almost the opposite
        of the analytic attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
        Explicit rules ❌
        <br />
        Closed definitions ❌
        <br />
        Declarations of completion ❌
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead:
    </p>

    <p>
        Probability.
        <br />
        Continuity.
        <br />
        The coexistence of ambiguity.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI does not define
        each individual leaf.
    </p>

    <p>
        It looks first
        at the distribution of the forest as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point,
        an uncomfortable question emerges.
    </p>

    <p>
        Was the assumption
        we held for so long—
        that “sufficiently precise analysis,
        accumulated enough,
        will reveal the whole”—
        ever really correct?
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter how precisely
        one draws each leaf,
        the climate or ecology of the forest
        may still remain invisible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course,
        this new kind of AI
        does not solve everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        Its explanations are weak.
        Its grounds are opaque.
        The boundary between truth and error
        is often blurred.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, one thing has become clear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Meaning does not arise
        only within closed ontologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        This realization
        forces us to look again
        at ontology completion.
    </p>

    <p>
        If completed definitions
        are the precondition of intelligence,
        then what are these systems
        that function without them?
    </p>

    <p>
        Conversely,
        if such systems can handle meaning,
        what, then,
        was the completion
        we were so obsessed with for?
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not to say
        that analytic philosophy was wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        It accomplished precisely
        what it set out to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        What has changed
        is that its limits
        are now unmistakable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Analysis was
        one mode of intelligence,
        not intelligence itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        The arrival of AI
        calls for a philosophical return.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not the question of
        completed definitions
        versus perfect understanding,
        but the question of
        how to work together
        under the assumption of incompleteness.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next part,
        we will push this question to the end.
    </p>

    <p>
        After letting go
        of the old ideal of completion,
        what kind of ontology
        can we still have?
    </p>

    <p>
        Not completion,
        but coexistence
        as an alternative.
    </p>

<section id="part-8-coexistence">
    <h1>Part VIII</h1>
    <h2>Back to the Whole: Coexistence Instead of Completion</h2>
    <h3>— Toward a New Concept of Ontology</h3>

    <p>
        To abandon completion
        does not mean
        to abandon the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        What we gave up
        was not the whole itself,
        but the belief
        that we could possess
        a completed whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        This difference is not trivial.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Gödel,
        we already know:
    </p>

    <p>
        No system
        can fully explain itself.
        <br />
        No ontology
        can completely close off
        what lies outside it.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet,
        we continue
        to build ontologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a contradiction.
        It is a necessity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem is not
        which ontology we have,
        but what kind of relationship
        we form with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The moment completion becomes the goal,
        ontology turns into
        a device for closing questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        When coexistence is assumed,
        ontology becomes
        a device for coordinating questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        A coexistential ontology
        has the following characteristics:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>It assumes no single final classification.</li>
        <li>It allows the overlap of multiple perspectives.</li>
        <li>It treats conflict not as error, but as information.</li>
        <li>It prioritizes connection over closure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Such an ontology asks less
        “What is this?”
        and more
        “Where and how is this used?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, the whole
        is not the goal,
        but the background.
    </p>

    <p>
        A forest
        is not the sum of its leaves.
        But without leaves,
        there is no forest.
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole is not a structure
        to be completed,
        but a field
        in which parts
        continually affect one another.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI offers an experimental glimpse
        of this possibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Large-scale models
        operate meaningfully
        without presupposing
        a single ontology.
    </p>

    <p>
        They form context
        not through definitional closure,
        but through the coexistence of patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not
        the end of ontology,
        but a transformation
        of its role.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology Completion
        is still necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Systems must,
        at some point,
        be closed.
        Decisions must,
        somewhere,
        be made.
    </p>

    <p>
        But such completion
        should not be understood
        as a declaration of truth,
        but as the drawing
        of a boundary of responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Up to this point,
        we take responsibility.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond that,
        we must negotiate
        with other ontologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology no longer
        needs to be singular.
    </p>

    <p>
        Multiple ontologies
        can coexist simultaneously,
        even without full translation
        between them.
    </p>

    <p>
        What matters
        is the meta-relationship
        that allows movement
        between them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overlapping maps
        reveal more
        than a single completed one.
    </p>

    <p>
        This series
        was not written
        to deny the idea of completion.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was written,
        rather,
        to return that idea
        to its proper place.
    </p>

    <p>
        Completion
        is not a statement about the world,
        but the name
        of a way of working
        that we choose.
    </p>

    <p>
        We still want
        to organize.
        <br />
        To classify.
        <br />
        To close.
    </p>

    <p>
        That desire
        does not disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
        But now,
        we no longer need
        to mistake it
        for something absolute.
    </p>

    <p>
        The moment we choose coexistence
        over completion,
        ontology becomes once again
        a tool for thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not a tool for closing,
        but a tool for connecting.

    <h1>Epilogue</h1>
    <h2>Writing “Completion” One Last Time</h2>

    <p>
        If we were to write the word
        “completion”
        just once more,
        it would be like this.
    </p>

    <p>
        We tried to draw a single map
        while facing the world,
        and to stamp the word
        “completion”
        at its edge.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the moment the brush touched,
        the canvas exceeded its own boundary
        and revealed
        a wider margin.
    </p>

    <p>
        That margin is not a lack,
        but a space
        where questions
        not yet asked
        are breathing.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Completion” is no longer
        an ideal that has vanished without remainder.
    </p>

    <p>
        It remains
        as a single sentence
        in which we declare
        how far we take responsibility,
        and from where
        we accept the questions of others.
    </p>

    <p>
        A promise
        not to cross one line,
        and at the same time,
        an invitation
        to let it overlap
        with someone else’s.
    </p>

    <p>
        So let us leave
        the final page
        blank.
    </p>

    <p>
        When someone writes
        a new question
        upon that empty space,
        this map
        will expand once again.
    </p>

    <p>
        That is the only way
        in which
        we can be
        eternal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The only form of completion
        left to us.
