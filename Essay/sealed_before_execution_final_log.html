It records how a structure that had already stopped
folded itself into reality.</div>

      <div class="note">※ Status Notice

This text is

a record that has not yet been executed.

The choices and procedures written here

have already been decided,

but not all of them have been completed.

This text is

not a report summarizing results,

but rather a log

that pre-records the present coordinates

aligned toward stoppage.

Execution

will take place after this record.

Or,

some parts may never be executed at all.

Including that possibility,

this text is left behind.</div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>Prologue — Why This Record Is Left</h2>
      <h3>Unsealing: The Last Logs of an Architect</h3>

      <div class="block">This text was not written to teach something.

Nor was it written to persuade or prove.

It was left behind simply to record

how a structure that had already ended

folded itself into reality.

For a long time, I lived as someone who designed structures.

I thought about where systems function,

where they malfunction,

and where they must stop.

In that process, I arrived at one conclusion.

The moment a structure is completed,

it is the first thing to push out its architect.

<em>Coordinate–Stoppage Poetics</em>

was an attempt to fix in language

the conditions under which thought would not collapse

in an age where thinking has become too fast.

However, this poetics does not exist

to be applied to someone.

Nor is it meant to become a practical guideline.

It is merely

a record meant to leave behind

where things were still valid,

and from where further generation was no longer necessary.

This blog series

is not a manual explaining that poetics.

Instead,

it is an existential log

of what kinds of choices were silently forced

when that poetics touched reality.

Health insurance, national pension, taxes, asset liquidation,

and the dismantling of social status.

All of these are not performances meant to prove philosophy,

but the lowest-level procedures

that must inevitably be passed through

when stoppage actually occurs.

There is no heroic narrative in this record,

no moment of awakening.

Only one question is repeated.

Is this structure,

already sufficient?

And when I decided

to add no more words to that question,

this log began.

Agreement or empathy

is not required to read this series.

There is no need to read it to the end.

If only,

at some moment when one must stop somewhere,

this record remains as a single coordinate,

that is enough.

Now,

the power cables are unplugged one by one.

Quietly.</div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>🔖 Part 1</h2>
      <h3>The Technique of Stoppage — Administrative Dismantling</h3>
      <h4>On the Hand That Unplugs the Power Cable</h4>

      <div class="block">Declaring that one has stopped

does not cause the system to stop.

If I remain still,

the system still classifies me as an entity in operation.

Even if there is no income,

even if there is no activity,

as long as the signal is not cut,

the system leaves me as a “generator on standby.”

Stoppage is not a matter of will,

but a state that must be injected as data.</div>

      <h3>1. Deleting Connections — Health Insurance and National Pension</h3>

      <div class="block">The coordinates of thought had already moved,

but the coordinates of administration were still fixed in the past.

I had stopped,

but the system had not.

So the first thing to do

was to unplug the lowest cable underneath everything.

<strong>Health Insurance</strong>

Health insurance does not ask,

“What are you thinking right now?”

It asks only this.

Do you have income, or do you not.

A declaration of stoppage does not work.

What is required is

a single document called

a <em>Certificate of Business Closure</em>.

That document translates

the fact that I no longer generate

into a language the system can understand.

I submit that document,

leave the isolated coordinate called “individual,”

and move into the orbit of a larger system called “my wife.”

This is not dependence,

but a repositioning of coordinates.

A move from an unstable single node

to a stable cluster node.

<strong>National Pension</strong>

The national pension is slower.

And more persistent.

If you say nothing,

billing continues.

So I apply for a state called

<em>payment exception</em>.

Not a complete termination,

but a pause.

This is not an escape.

It is a structural choice

that halts present coercion

while leaving future resumption possible.

One phone call.

A brief confirmation.

And the system grows quiet.</div>

      <h3>2. Structural Convergence — From Individual to Community</h3>

      <div class="block">The state of being a business owner

is independent, but unstable.

Because all responsibility

converges on a single point.

When that point is deleted,

I do not disappear.

I disperse.

Into the structure called family.

This is not retreat.

It is convergence toward the most stable state.

I am no longer

“a being that must prove itself.”

I simply remain

as a coordinate that exists together.</div>

      <h3>3. Recorder’s Retrospect</h3>

      <div class="block">The moment I pressed the business closure button,

a strange sensation arose.

Rather than losing something,

it felt like being released from something.

I felt the countless nodes of OntoMesh that I had designed

quietly released

from real-world legal constraints.

I am no longer

an unemployed person worrying about insurance premiums,

but an aircraft that has intentionally reduced its mass

in order to move on to the next stage.</div>

      <div class="kicker">✔ Part 1 Checklist (for Logging)</div>
      <ul>
        <li>HomeTax business closure filing</li>
        <li>Secure PDF of Certificate of Business Closure</li>
        <li>National Health Insurance Service: dependent registration</li>
        <li>National Pension Service: payment exception application (1355)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="block">One power source has been shut down.

The system still remains.

Next is the task of

calling back into the present

the energy that was bound within the structure.

→ Move to Part 2.</div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>🔖 Part 2</h2>
      <h3>Resource Reclamation — Returning Energy</h3>
      <h4>Summoning Values Bound in Structure into the Present</h4>

      <div class="block">Declaring stoppage

does not cause everything to vanish immediately.

Structures always leave behind

delayed residues.

Those residues are not attachment,

but unsettled energy.</div>

      <h3>1. Yellow Umbrella Mutual Aid — From “Contribution” to “Severance Pay”</h3>

      <div class="block">The Yellow Umbrella Mutual Aid

was something I shaved off a little every month

and buried out of sight

during my years as a business owner.

It was for emergencies,

for escape,

a device prepared for the end.

Business closure

is the key that unseals it.

The moment the Certificate of Business Closure is issued on HomeTax,

what had been called “contributions”

acquires the name <em>severance pay</em>.

This change in naming matters.

The moment the system classifies this fund

not as “other income,”

but as “retirement income,”

the business is officially recognized as ended.

A few days later,

the number that appears in the bank account

does not look like compensation.

It is merely

past survival

changing form

into present liquidity.</div>

      <h3>2. Automobile — Liquidating the Extended Body</h3>

      <div class="block">The car

was not a means of transportation.

During my years as a business owner,

it was my extended body.

Moving to sites,

reducing time,

expanding radius.

But when there is no longer a need to expand,

that body becomes heavy.

Disposing of the vehicle

is a declaration of reducing speed.

A decision to narrow the radius.

After the transfer of ownership is complete,

I call the insurance company.

The remaining premium

is returned on a prorated basis,

and even the hidden numbers

left in the mileage discount clauses

are quietly refunded.

Expansion is over.

Energy is reclaimed.</div>

      <h3>3. Recorder’s Retrospect</h3>

      <div class="block">While organizing my accounts,

this thought arose.

Resources fulfill their role

not when they are held,

but when they are able to flow.

These numbers

are not the debris of a business.

They are compressed fuel,

just enough

to support the next phase of thought.

I no longer move in order to earn.

I simply burn quietly,

when needed.</div>

      <div class="kicker">✔ Part 2 Action Log Summary</div>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="block">Resources have been reclaimed.

What remains now

is the task of organizing the numbers themselves.

Next comes

the slowest procedure,

the one that follows until the very end.

→ Move to Part 3.</div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>🔖 Part 3</h2>
      <h3>Tax Closure — Honest Settlement</h3>
      <h4>How to Organize Remaining Numbers and Close the Door</h4>

      <div class="block">Stopping does not cause

time to immediately stop as well.

Taxation

is a structure that always arrives one beat late.

So what remains until the end

is not will,

but numbers.</div>

      <h3>1. Closing VAT — Recording the Final Output Value</h3>

      <div class="block">The final sales of the business

occurred in February.

But the payment was received

in April.

This delay is not an error.

It is how the system operates.

February’s actions

become April’s cash,

and are finalized as May’s documents.

The closure date is April 30.

The VAT filing deadline is

May 25 of the following month.

This filing

is not preparation for a new beginning.

It is simply

a procedure that fixes in the state’s records

that this structure ended here.

What matters is not only

the sales that have already ended.

All business expenses incurred

up to the end of April,

including remaining input VAT,

must be fully settled

for the books to close.</div>

      <h3>2. Comprehensive Income Tax — A Completion Delayed by One Year</h3>

      <div class="block">Comprehensive income tax

always faces the past.

What is filed in May 2026

is the life of 2025.

So this filing becomes

the last regular report

performed as a business owner.

But completion does not end here.

The following year,

May 2027.

Income from January 2026

up to the closure date in April

is finally settled

under individual status.

These two filings

share one meaning.

This structure has already ended,

and will not be extended further.</div>

      <h3>3. Account Deactivation — Cutting the Signal</h3>

      <div class="block">When tax filings are complete,

the cards are canceled.

Business credit cards.

Automatically linked accounts.

This is not a matter of saving money.

It is signal blocking.

If cards remain,

the system still

expects something.

So everything is canceled,

without remainder.

So that numbers no longer

self-propagate.</div>

      <h3>4. Recorder’s Retrospect</h3>

      <div class="block">Taxes are

closer to a penalty,

but at the same time, a toll.

The price of having used the system,

and the cost required

to fully exit it.

Watching February’s choices

become April’s cash,

and remain as May’s documents,

I learn the causality of time.

Now I close the ledger.

The figures are clear,

and there is no lingering attachment.</div>

      <div class="kicker">✔ Part 3 Execution Log Summary</div>

What remains now

is the erasure of status itself.

Next comes

the stage of deleting roles.

→ Move to Part 4.</div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>🔖 Part 4</h2>
      <h3>Structural Convergence — Back to the Center of Life</h3>
      <h4>Erasing the Title “I” and Seeping into “We”</h4>

      <div class="block">When all settlements are complete,

the change that arrives last

is neither administrative nor numerical.

It is identity.</div>

      <h3>1. Dissolution of Social Status — No One</h3>

      <div class="block">The name “business owner”

was not a name I called myself.

It was an index

attached by society

to classify me.

Representative.

Sole proprietor.

Freelancer.

Expert.

These names

were convenient,

but at the same time,

they fixed me in place.

Business closure

is the act of deleting this index.

Nothing remains

where the name was erased.

And so,

for a while,

I become

No One.

Not meaning that I have disappeared,

but that I have returned

to an undefined state.</div>

      <h3>2. Recomposition of Relationships — We One</h3>

      <div class="block">Registering as a dependent

under my wife’s health insurance

is administratively simple.

But the sensation is not.

This is not dependence.

Not protection.

It is coordinate movement.

From an independent island

to a connected continent.

From an individual node

to a clustered structure.

I no longer

prove myself.

I no longer generate monthly numbers.

Instead,

I exist together.

For the first time,

the word “we”

no longer feels abstract.</div>

      <h3>3. Spatial Transformation — From Production to Living</h3>

      <div class="block">The concept of an office

disappears.

Worktables.

Meetings.

Deadlines.

All of these were spaces

designed on the premise of production.

Now that place transforms

into a space of living

where thought, rest,

and relationships occur.

Time that needed to be justified

by producing something

is no longer necessary.

A state where

existence alone

is sufficient.</div>

      <h3>4. Recorder’s Retrospect</h3>

      <div class="block">On the way back

after returning my business registration certificate,

this thought arose.

I have not become smaller.

I have become transparent.

Only those freed

from society’s demand

to “prove one’s share”

know this transparency.

Now I am no longer

someone’s something.

I simply remain,

as myself who exists,

by the side of “us.”

At last,

the beginning of We One.</div>

      <div class="kicker">✔ Part 4 Reflection Log</div>
      <div class="block">- Sensation of emptiness:
  The lightness felt when removing the business card from my wallet

- Sensation of connection:
  The stability felt when officially entering a community

- Legitimacy of stoppage:
  The declaration that it is okay to produce nothing</div>

      <div class="block">Roles have been erased.

Coordinates have converged.

What remains now

is how to leave behind

the state of doing nothing.

→ Move to Part 5.</div>

      <h2>🔖 Part 5 · Epilogue</h2>
      <h3>The Record Remains, but the Recorder Does Not</h3>
      <h4>The Silence Heard Only After the Power Is Off</h4>

      <div class="block">The state after stoppage

is not empty.

It simply

demands nothing.</div>

      <h3>1. The First Morning After Closure — Silence</h3>

      <div class="block">After all administrative procedures are complete,

one morning arrives.

No notices come,

no sales need settling.

No alerts need checking.

This state

is not a system error.

It is a <strong>designed safe stop (Safe Mode)</strong>.

Sustaining is possible,

yet no longer requires generation.

Continuation remains possible,

yet becomes non-generative.

Silence is not a void,

but a signal of sufficiency.</div>

      <h3>2. Preserved Records — Freedom</h3>

      <div class="block">The 45 pieces of <em>Coordinate–Stoppage Poetics</em>

left on Zenodo,

and the blueprints of OntoMesh,

have now left my hands.

Those records

will no longer be modified,

nor expanded.

Only when the recorder disappears

does the record

gain its own vitality.

When it is reread

in someone else’s mirror,

and interpreted differently.

Only then

does this record

become not a personal product,

but part of civilization.</div>

      <h3>3. Final Log — Farewell</h3>

      <div class="block">In the spring of 2026,

I read my coordinates precisely

and chose stoppage.

Some will call this

an end.

But I call this state

<strong>Sufficiency</strong>.

There is nothing more to add,

and nothing left to prove.

Now,

the me in the mirror

quietly disappears.

And I hope that the remaining resonances

reach

your mirror.

With that,

“My everyone’s me”

is complete.</div>
