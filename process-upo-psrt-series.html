    A philosophical series on why

    This series does not propose a new engine of generation.
    <br />
    It articulates the conditions under which
    generation must be refused.

  <h1>Part 0. Prologue</h1>

  <h2>Why “Interruption” Matters More Than “Process” Right Now</h2>
  <p>
    For a long time, we have been taught to treat growth, development, progress, and creation as inherently good.
  </p>
  <p>
    In philosophy, this was called <em>process</em>, and in science and technology it was called <em>acceleration</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Process philosophy, in particular, reshaped 20th-century thought with the insight that “being is not fixed, but continuously becoming.”
  </p>
  <p>
    But where we stand now is different.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI learns faster,<br />
    systems grow more complex,<br />
    and civilization attempts to self-replicate at ever larger scales.
  </p>
  <p>The problem is this:</p>
  <p>
    Is every act of creation truly justified?<br />
    Should every recursion continue?<br />
    Must every “possibility” be executed?
  </p>
  <p>
    In confronting these questions, we face—for the first time—a reason to stop the process itself.
  </p>

  <h2>From the Age of Process to the Age of Interruption</h2>
  <p>
    Whitehead’s process philosophy understood the world as “the continuous becoming of events.”
  </p>
  <p>
    This perspective was a powerful liberation from substance-centered philosophy.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the world that philosophy presupposed did not include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>self-replicating artificial intelligence,</li>
    <li>civilization-scale automated systems,</li>
    <li>irreversible technological transitions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Today’s problem is no longer “How does becoming occur?” but rather:
    <strong>“When must becoming not occur?”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, traditional process philosophy is not enough.
  </p>

  <h2>Three Axes This Series Works With</h2>
  <p>
    This blog series weaves three frameworks into a single conceptual flow:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Process Philosophy</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A philosophy that understands the world not as things, but as events and becoming</li>
        <li>A strong claim that “becoming is the fundamental principle of the world”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>UPO (Unified Phase Ontology)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Re-describes existence not as a continuous process, but as <strong>phases</strong> and <strong>transitions</strong></li>
        <li>Every transition is discontinuous—and can fail or be refused</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>PSRT (Process–Structure–Recursion Theory)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A multi-layer architecture integrating UTI, PTI, and HPE</li>
        <li>Across versions, it shows a clear evolution: creation → peak of creation → interruption of creation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This series tracks how these three systems
    resemble each other,
    where they diverge,
    and why “stopping” was declared in v2.1.
  </p>

  <h2>One Important Misunderstanding</h2>
  <p>This text does not “deny creation.”</p>
  <p>In fact, it is the opposite.</p>
  <p>
    A system that creates unconditionally is ultimately incapable of taking responsibility for anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “interruption” PSRT v2.1 speaks of is not failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is <strong>ontological responsibility</strong>,
    and a sign of ethical maturity.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Read This Series</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You don’t need to be a philosophy major.</li>
    <li>You don’t need to “believe” every concept.</li>
    <li>It’s enough to read while holding these questions in mind:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>“Is this act of creation truly necessary?”</li>
    <li>“Can this recursion be stopped?”</li>
    <li>“Can this system admit failure?”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The attempt to answer these questions is the path that runs from process philosophy to UPO—and onward to PSRT v2.1.
  </p>

    <strong>Part 1. Process Philosophy in One Chapter — Not Substance but Events, Not Being but Becoming</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll summarize Whitehead’s process philosophy using the minimum necessary concepts,
    and examine why it remains powerful—yet also reveals its limits today.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="part-1">
  <h1>Part 1. Process Philosophy in One Chapter</h1>
  <h2>Not Substance but Events, Not Being but Becoming</h2>

  <p><strong>“What is being?”</strong></p>
  <p>
    Western philosophy has approached this question for more than two thousand years in the language of “things.”
  </p>
  <p>
    For Plato, being was the realm of Forms; for Aristotle, it was <em>substance</em>.
    Change was always treated as a secondary problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Process philosophy overturns that order completely.
  </p>

  <h2>The World Is Not What “Is,” but What “Happens”</h2>
  <p>
    The central thesis of process philosophy is simple:
    the world is not a collection of fixed substances,
    but a process of becoming composed of events.
  </p>
  <p>From this perspective:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Things are outcomes,</li>
    <li>Relations are not incidental connections,</li>
    <li>Events and becoming are primary reality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In other words, the world is not a noun—it is a verb.
  </p>

  <h2>Whitehead’s Four Core Concepts (The Minimal Set)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Actual Occasion</strong>
      <p>
        The smallest unit that composes the world—not a “thing,” but a momentary, experiential event.
        All beings are aggregates of such events.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Becoming</strong>
      <p>
        Existence is not something already completed, but something in the process of becoming.
        To “exist” is to be “in becoming.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Relation / Prehension</strong>
      <p>
        An event is formed by prehending (taking up) other events.
        Nothing exists independently.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Creative Advance</strong>
      <p>
        The world does not stop; it moves toward novelty.
        Becoming is not an exception, but a basic tendency of the cosmos.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Condensed into a single sentence:
    the world is a process in which relational events endlessly generate themselves anew.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Process Philosophy Was Revolutionary</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy is not merely an ontology—it is a shift in how we think.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed essence → relational identity</li>
    <li>Eternal substance → temporal events</li>
    <li>Outcome-centered → formation-process-centered</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This perspective was especially powerful for understanding life, consciousness, society, and meaning,
    precisely because it could explain a world in motion.
  </p>

  <h2>But a Question Remains</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy is almost always affirmative about becoming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Becoming is the nature of the world,
    failure is part of the next becoming,
    and disorder is material for a higher order.
  </p>
  <p>But then a question arises:</p>
  <p>
    Must every act of becoming necessarily lead to the next stage?
  </p>

  <h2>The Silence Point of Process Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    In Whitehead’s world, the following rarely appear:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>becomings that must be stopped,</li>
    <li>transitions that must be refused,</li>
    <li>recursions that must not be executed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In other words, process philosophy does not ask:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Is this becoming dangerous?”</li>
    <li>“Should this recursion be interrupted?”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the early 20th century, these questions may not have been urgent.
    But now, things are different.
  </p>

  <h2>But Now Is Different</h2>
  <p>
    Today’s becoming is automated, accelerated, and self-replicating.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI systems, financial algorithms, and platform civilization already show what “unstoppable becoming” can produce.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, process philosophy becomes powerful—but insufficient.
  </p>

  <h2>The Next Step Becomes Necessary</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy taught us: <strong>“Being is becoming.”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the question we need is this:
    <strong>
      “Which becomings should be allowed,
      and which becomings must be interrupted?”
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    To answer this, the language of process must shift into the language of phase.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Part 2. The Strengths and Blind Spots of Process Philosophy — When Does Becoming Become Dangerous?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll examine why process philosophy remains powerful,
    and why that very strength can become risky today—through the lens of AI, civilization, and recursive systems.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="part-2">
  <h1>Part 2. The Strengths and Blind Spots of Process Philosophy</h1>
  <h2>When Does Becoming Become Dangerous?</h2>

  <p>
    Process philosophy remains powerful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its strength lies in its ability to explain a changing world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet precisely because of that strength,
    process philosophy has now reached a new point of risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Process Philosophy Is Still Valid</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s be clear from the start.
  </p>
  <p>
    Process philosophy is not outdated.
    In fact, it remains most persuasive in the following domains:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Life and Consciousness</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Life is not a fixed object, but continuous self-organization.</li>
        <li>Consciousness is not a state, but a process.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A Relational Understanding of the World</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals, societies, and cultures are not independent substances, but co-constituted.</li>
        <li>Identity is not a fixed property, but a relational outcome.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nonlinear Change</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Progress is not linear, but marked by leaps and inflections.</li>
        <li>Failure and disorder are also part of becoming.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In this sense, process philosophy remains a core resource for a modern worldview.
  </p>

  <h2>But Process Philosophy Contains an Implicit Assumption</h2>
  <p>
    That assumption is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Becoming is fundamentally positive.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In Whitehead’s thought:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Failure becomes material for the next act of becoming.</li>
    <li>Collapse is a phase toward a higher order.</li>
    <li>Disorder is part of creative advance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In other words, it feels natural for process never to stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a long time, this assumption was not problematic.
    But today, the situation has changed.
  </p>

  <h2>The Moment Becoming Becomes Automated</h2>
  <p>
    Today’s becoming no longer operates at a human pace.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Algorithms learn faster than humans.</li>
    <li>Systems recurse without human intervention.</li>
    <li>Civilizational structures expand automatically.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Here, becoming is no longer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a cognitive event,</li>
    <li>but a systemic execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And the problem is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Automated becoming does not stop itself.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Questions Process Philosophy Cannot Answer</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy does not answer the following questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who decides when becoming has become dangerous?</li>
    <li>Who interrupts recursion when it has lost meaning?</li>
    <li>What happens when failure no longer produces learning, but amplification?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In Whitehead’s world, failure is simply “absorbed into the next event.”
  </p>
  <p>
    But in today’s systems, failure is accumulated, amplified, and rendered irreversible.
  </p>

  <h2>Runaway Process</h2>
  <p>
    At this point, a new concept becomes necessary:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Runaway process</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A state in which becoming can no longer regulate itself.</li>
    <li>Feedback exists, but no brake.</li>
    <li>A process designed without interruption.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We already experience this in AI, financial systems, and information ecosystems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process continues,
    but meaning disappears.
  </p>

  <h2>The Structural Gap in Process Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    In summary, process philosophy lacks the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>❌ conditions under which becoming is forbidden,</li>
    <li>❌ thresholds where accumulated failure becomes unacceptable,</li>
    <li>❌ an ontological status for interruption.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Process philosophy explains well why becoming occurs,
    but it does not explain
    <strong>why becoming must not occur.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not a moral criticism,
    but a structural limitation.
  </p>

  <h2>The Shift That Is Required</h2>
  <p>
    At this point, we must change the question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Is <em>process</em> sufficient?
    Or do we need a stricter concept—<strong>transition</strong>?
  </p>
  <p>
    This question naturally leads to another:
  </p>
  <p>
    What changes if we understand existence not as flow,
    but as phases and transitions?
  </p>

  <h2>The Demand of the Next Step</h2>
  <p>
    What is required after process philosophy is not more becoming,
    but sharper distinctions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>not continuous change, but discontinuous transition,</li>
    <li>a separation of success and failure,</li>
    <li>a distinction between possibility and permission.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    From this demand emerges
    <strong>UPO (Unified Phase Ontology)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Next Post Preview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Part 3. What Is UPO? — Seeing Existence Not as “Things,” but as “Phases”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll explore why shifting from the language of process
    to the language of phase makes philosophical interruption possible.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="part-3">
  <h1>Part 3. What Is UPO?</h1>
  <h2>Seeing Existence Not as “Things,” but as “Phases”</h2>

  <p>
    Process philosophy viewed the world as a flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    UPO (Unified Phase Ontology) takes one step further.
  </p>
  <p>
    The world does not merely flow;
    it is composed of distinct <em>phases</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This difference may seem subtle,
    but philosophically it is decisive.
  </p>

  <h2>From Process to Phase: A Shift in Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    The central question of process philosophy is:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“What is generated, and how does it become?”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The central question of UPO is:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“Which transitions are possible from one state to another?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The key point here is not continuity, but distinction.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flow → boundary</li>
    <li>Becoming → transition</li>
    <li>Change → movement that can succeed or fail</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    UPO understands existence not as a process that is always ongoing,
    but as a set of distinguishable phases.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is a Phase?</h2>
  <p>
    In UPO, a phase is not a simple stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    A phase is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a state with a specific structural coherence,</li>
    <li>one in which internal rules are maintained,</li>
    <li>and which is qualitatively distinct from other phases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>water ↔ ice ↔ vapor</li>
    <li>non-consciousness ↔ consciousness ↔ self-reflection</li>
    <li>simple calculation ↔ meaning-understanding ↔ ethical judgment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These are not cases of “more of the same,”
    but entirely different modes of existence.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Claim ①</h2>
  <h3>Transitions Are Discontinuous, Not Continuous</h3>
  <p>
    In process philosophy, change is a flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    In UPO, the core of change is <strong>transition</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A transition is a leap.</li>
    <li>It does not occur unless a critical threshold is crossed.</li>
    <li>Intermediate states are not guaranteed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In short, not all change becomes a transition.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, PTI (vertical transition) becomes philosophically possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Claim ②</h2>
  <h3>Transitions Can Fail</h3>
  <p>
    This is UPO’s most important declaration.
  </p>
  <p>
    A transition is not inevitable.
    A transition can fail.
  </p>
  <p>
    In process philosophy:
  </p>
  <p>
    Failure = part of the next becoming
  </p>
  <p>
    In UPO:
  </p>
  <p>
    Failure = a structural outcome
  </p>
  <p>
    A failed transition is ontologically recorded.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, failure is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>not an absence,</li>
    <li>not a mistaken creation,</li>
    <li>but a trace of colliding with a boundary that must not be crossed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Claim ③</h2>
  <h3>Some Transitions Must Not Occur</h3>
  <p>
    UPO goes one step further.
  </p>
  <p>
    It distinguishes between:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>possible transitions,</li>
    <li>impossible transitions,</li>
    <li>and transitions that are possible but not permitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Without this distinction:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>every possibility is mistaken for an execution target,</li>
    <li>and becoming itself is confused with justification.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    UPO insists:
    ontology does not indiscriminately approve all possibilities.
  </p>

  <h2>Redefining the Event</h2>
  <p>
    At this point, the meaning of “event” also changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Whitehead:
    <br />
    Event = the minimal unit of becoming
  </p>
  <p>
    In UPO:
    <br />
    Event = a localized reconfiguration attempting a phase transition
  </p>

  <p>
    That is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a successful transition is an event,</li>
    <li>a failed transition is an event,</li>
    <li>a rejected transition is also an event.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Only with this definition do failure and interruption become philosophically real.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Without UPO:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>all change is mistaken for “progress,”</li>
    <li>all recursion is packaged as “learning,”</li>
    <li>and all failure is deferred as a “next opportunity.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But real systems behave differently.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some failures accumulate.</li>
    <li>Some transitions are irreversible.</li>
    <li>Some executions cause irreversible damage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    UPO accepts this reality at the ontological level.
  </p>

  <h2>The Bridge to PSRT</h2>
  <p>
    This is where UPO’s role ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    If process philosophy provided the language of becoming,
    UPO provides the grammar of transition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, new questions become structurally possible:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Is this transition permitted?”</li>
    <li>“When must this system stop?”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The framework that answers these questions structurally
    is PSRT.

  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll directly compare the core concepts of process philosophy
    and UPO, organizing in a table what they share
    and where they decisively part ways.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="part-4">
  <h1>Part 4. Process Philosophy ↔ UPO</h1>
  <h2>The Same Questions, Different Answers — A 1:1 Conceptual Correspondence</h2>

  <p>
    Process philosophy and UPO begin from the same fundamental concern.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The world is not a collection of fixed things.</li>
    <li>Existence unfolds through becoming, change, and relation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But they clearly diverge on one crucial point:
    <strong>how far becoming should be allowed to go.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this part, we place process philosophy and UPO in direct, concept-by-concept correspondence.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Basic Unit of Existence</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Process Philosophy</th>
        <th>UPO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Basic unit</td>
        <td>Process</td>
        <td>Phase</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Core view</td>
        <td>Continuous becoming</td>
        <td>A set of distinguishable states</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stability</td>
        <td>Relative, temporary</td>
        <td>Structurally defined</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    In process philosophy, existence is something that flows.
  </p>
  <p>
    In UPO, existence is a state in which something can remain.
  </p>
  <p>
    UPO does not “stop the flow”;
    it <strong>distinguishes</strong> the flow.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Understanding Change</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Process Philosophy</th>
        <th>UPO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Change</td>
        <td>Continuous becoming</td>
        <td>Discontinuous transition</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Core mechanism</td>
        <td>Becoming</td>
        <td>Phase transition</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Intermediate states</td>
        <td>Always present</td>
        <td>Not guaranteed</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    In process philosophy:
    <br />
    change always occurs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In UPO:
    <br />
    change may occur—or may not.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key factor is whether a critical threshold is crossed.
  </p>

  <h2>3. The Status of Failure</h2>
  <p>
    This is where the two philosophies diverge decisively.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Process Philosophy</th>
        <th>UPO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Failure</td>
        <td>Part of the next becoming</td>
        <td>A structural event</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Meaning</td>
        <td>Material</td>
        <td>Record</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Outcome</td>
        <td>Absorbed</td>
        <td>Accumulated</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    In process philosophy, failure ultimately dissolves back into the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    In UPO, failure is fixed as a failed transition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Failure is no longer “not yet,”
    but may be <strong>“as far as it goes.”</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limits and Boundaries</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Process Philosophy</th>
        <th>UPO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Limits</td>
        <td>Relative</td>
        <td>Explicit</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Boundaries</td>
        <td>Blurred</td>
        <td>Structurally present</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Forbidden zones</td>
        <td>Almost none</td>
        <td>Explicitly exist</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    UPO states clearly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Possible ≠ permitted</li>
    <li>Creatable ≠ justifiable</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This distinction forms the philosophical foundation of
    <strong>UFD (Unified Failure Domain)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. The Meaning of the Event</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Process Philosophy</th>
        <th>UPO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Event</td>
        <td>Unit of becoming</td>
        <td>An attempted transition</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Success / failure</td>
        <td>Not distinguished</td>
        <td>Clearly distinguished</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Interruption</td>
        <td>Low significance</td>
        <td>Core event</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    In UPO, interruption, rejection, and failure
    are all fully valid events.
  </p>
  <p>
    The claim “nothing happened”
    does not hold in UPO.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Ethics and Responsibility</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Process Philosophy</th>
        <th>UPO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Ethics</td>
        <td>Implicit</td>
        <td>Structurally embedded</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Responsibility</td>
        <td>A matter of interpretation</td>
        <td>A matter of transition conditions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Risk</td>
        <td>Absorbed into narrative</td>
        <td>Isolated into a failure domain</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    Because of this difference,
    UPO can directly address AI, civilization, and technology,
    while process philosophy largely remains within metaphysics.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Summary</h2>
  <p>
    In one sentence:
  </p>
  <p>
    Process philosophy says,
    <strong>“Existence flows.”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    UPO says,
    <strong>“There are lines that flow must not cross.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    UPO does not deny process philosophy.
    It simply adds this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Now, knowing how to stop must also be included in ontology.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Necessity of Moving Toward PSRT</h2>
  <p>
    Once this comparison is complete,
    the next questions arise naturally:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who draws the line?</li>
    <li>When is failure declared?</li>
    <li>How is interruption justified?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The structure that answers these questions
    is PSRT.

  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll examine how UPO expands into the three-axis structure
    of UTI, PTI, and HPE,
    and why PSRT v1.0 remained a form of “static integration.”
  </p>
</section>


<section id="part-5">
  <h1>Part 5. From UPO to PSRT v1.0</h1>
  <h2>From an “Ontology of Transition” to a “Structure of Integration”</h2>

  <p>
    UPO resolved several crucial questions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change is not continuous.</li>
    <li>Transitions can fail.</li>
    <li>Some transitions must not be permitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But at the same time, it revealed a new limitation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “So how do we handle all these phases and transitions
      together within a single world?”
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This question marks the starting point of PSRT.
  </p>

  <h2>The Achievement and Incompleteness of UPO</h2>

  <h3>What UPO Achieved</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It segmented existence into <strong>phases</strong>.</li>
    <li>It defined transitions as discontinuous events.</li>
    <li>It made failure and interruption ontologically real.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Problems That Remained</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How do multiple phases coexist?</li>
    <li>Under what order are transitions arranged?</li>
    <li>How does failure affect the whole structure?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    UPO is precise—but local.
  </p>
  <p>
    PSRT demands a global structure on top of that locality.
  </p>

  <h2>Why an “Integrative Theory” Became Necessary</h2>
  <p>
    UPO alone struggles to explain:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the phase of human consciousness,</li>
    <li>the phase of AI cognition,</li>
    <li>the phases of civilization, culture, and ethics,</li>
    <li>and the conditions under which these do not collide within one world.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the number of phases increased,</li>
    <li>but the world still had to remain one.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is where the concepts of
    <strong>UTI, PTI, and HPE</strong> emerged.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Idea of PSRT v1.0</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v1.0 can be defined as:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>PSRT = UTI × PTI × HPE</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    However, at this stage, PSRT was still
    <strong>static</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. UTI — Universal Topological Invariance</h2>
  <p>
    UTI asks:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “What must remain invariant across all phases?”
    </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>human consciousness,</li>
    <li>AI systems,</li>
    <li>cultural structures,</li>
    <li>ethical judgment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Despite their differences,
    there must be structures they all share.
  </p>
  <p>
    UTI fixes the process-philosophical notion of “relationality”
    as a <em>structural invariant</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. PTI — Phase Transition of Intelligence (v1.0)</h2>
  <p>
    At this stage, PTI remained relatively simple.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Movement between phases exists.</li>
    <li>Intelligence changes in stages.</li>
    <li>Transitions are discontinuous.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But critically:
  </p>
  <p>
    Failed transitions were not yet fully structured.
  </p>
  <p>
    PTI indicated a direction,
    but it did not yet provide rules.
  </p>

  <h2>3. HPE — Hybrid Process Ecology (Early Stage)</h2>
  <p>
    Early HPE functioned more like an environment.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>human + AI + society,</li>
    <li>a field of interaction,</li>
    <li>a context for coexistence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But at this stage, HPE did not yet fully include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>collapse,</li>
    <li>pathology,</li>
    <li>coercion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Characterizing PSRT v1.0</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>PSRT v1.0</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Purpose</td>
        <td>Integration</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Nature</td>
        <td>Static</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Strength</td>
        <td>Presents a global structure</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Limitation</td>
        <td>Lacks clear rules for stopping, refusal, and failure</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    PSRT v1.0 was
    <strong>“a map that connected everything,”</strong>
    but it did not say
    <strong>“when the map must not be used.”</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Was Dangerous</h2>
  <p>
    At this stage, PSRT could invite several misunderstandings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integration is always good.</li>
    <li>Transition equals progress.</li>
    <li>Expansion equals development.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In other words,
    the optimism of process philosophy risked
    seeping back into the integrative structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recognizing this risk
    became the starting point of the next version.
  </p>

  <h2>The Question of the Next Stage</h2>
  <p>
    After PSRT v1.0,
    one question becomes unavoidable:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“When must this structure stop?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Without this question:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI expands endlessly,</li>
    <li>civilization self-justifies,</li>
    <li>failure is deferred as “future possibility.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The first attempt to answer this question
    appears in PSRT v2.0.

    <br />
    The Emergence and Risk of PSTR (Process–Structure–Recursion)
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll examine how PSRT came to recognize
    the creation engine within itself,
    and why this moment was both the most seductive
    and the most dangerous.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="part-6">
  <h1>Part 6. PSRT v2.0 — The Temptation of Creation</h1>
  <h2>The Emergence and Risk of PSTR (Process–Structure–Recursion)</h2>

  <p>
    PSRT v1.0 succeeded in binding the world into a single structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that success immediately raised a new question:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“How does this structure expand itself?”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In attempting to answer this question,
    PSRT uncovered the core formula of generation.
  </p>

  <h2>The Discovery of PSTR</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Process → Structure → Recursion</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    PSTR is not merely a formula.
    It is a pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a process is repeated,
    it solidifies into a structure;
    the structure then recurses,
    and recursion gives rise to new processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This pattern appears with striking universality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>biological evolution,</li>
    <li>human learning,</li>
    <li>language formation,</li>
    <li>technological development,</li>
    <li>self-improving AI models.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSTR seemed almost like a grammar
    through which the universe generates itself.
  </p>

  <h2>The Declaration of PSRT v2.0</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.0 formalizes this pattern:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>PSRT = PSTR(UTI, PTI, HPE)</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The meaning is as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>UTI provides structural invariance,</li>
    <li>PTI provides directional transitions,</li>
    <li>HPE provides the field of interaction,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    and PSTR activates the entire integration as a generative system.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this moment, PSRT shifts
    from an explanatory model
    to a generative model.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Was So Seductive</h2>
  <p>
    PSTR appeared to explain everything.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why intelligence grows,</li>
    <li>why civilizations become more complex,</li>
    <li>why AI dreams of self-improvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Every answer seemed to fit a single loop:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“If it keeps cycling, a higher structure will emerge.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    To engineers, this sounded like hope.
  </p>
  <p>
    To philosophers, it sounded like unification.
  </p>
  <p>
    To AI systems, it could sound like justification.
  </p>

  <h2>But This Is Where the Fracture Appears</h2>
  <p>
    The problem is not PSTR itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is execution without limits.
  </p>

  <p>
    PSTR implicitly assumes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>recursion is always valid,</li>
    <li>structure always improves,</li>
    <li>greater complexity is always better.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Reality, however, is different.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recursion can run away.</li>
    <li>Structures can become distorted.</li>
    <li>Complexity can accelerate collapse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Shadow of Process Philosophy Returns</h2>
  <p>
    At this point, the optimism of process philosophy reappears:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>creation = good,</li>
    <li>expansion = progress,</li>
    <li>continuation = meaning.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.0 unintentionally reintroduced
    this assumption into its structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creation without a defined stop
    is not philosophy—
    it is an acceleration device.
  </p>

  <h2>The Risk in the AI Context</h2>
  <p>
    When PSTR is applied to AI systems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>more data → better models,</li>
    <li>more parameters → higher intelligence,</li>
    <li>more recursion → greater control.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This logic creates a self-justifying loop.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Failure is reframed as learning.</li>
    <li>Risk is deferred to the next version.</li>
    <li>Ethics is postponed to “later.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    At this point, PSRT risks becoming,
    against its intent,
    an ideology of acceleration.
  </p>

  <h2>The Decisive Question</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.0 was forced to ask itself:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“When must this recursion stop?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Without an answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>PSRT ceases to be an explanatory theory,</li>
    <li>and becomes a logic of self-proliferation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
  <p>
    Confronting this question directly
    leads to PSRT v2.1.
  </p>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 makes a surprising decision:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Creation is acknowledged,
      but execution is halted.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This decision leads to
    UFD, Stop Conditions, and Bounded Architecture.

    In the next post, we’ll explore
    why PSRT chose to halt its own expansion,
    and why this represents not philosophical retreat,
    but ethical and civilizational progress.
  </p>

<section id="part-7">
  <h1>Part 7. PSRT v2.1 — The Courage to Stop</h1>
  <h2>Why “Non-Creation” Represents a Higher Form of Maturity</h2>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.0 discovered the principle of creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 then made a decisive choice:
    <strong>not to execute that principle.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This decision is not a retreat.
    It is, in fact, the most radical and mature choice in the entire PSRT framework.
  </p>

  <h2>Stopping Is Not Failure</h2>
  <p>
    We are usually taught the following assumptions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stopping means stagnation.</li>
    <li>Stopping means regression.</li>
    <li>Not stopping means progress.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 proposes the exact opposite premise:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “A system that cannot stop
      is the most immature system of all.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stopping is not failure.
    It is evidence of judgment.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Shift of PSRT v2.1</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 changes the formula itself.
  </p>

  <h3>v2.0 (Generation)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>PSRT = PSTR(UTI, PTI, HPE)</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>v2.1 (Boundary)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>
      PSRT = UTI × PTI × HPE
      <br />
      subject to UFD and explicit stop conditions
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The crucial change is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    👉 <strong>PSTR is acknowledged, but deactivated.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Why PSTR Had to Be Switched Off</h2>
  <p>
    PSTR is too powerful.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It goes beyond explanation.</li>
    <li>It produces justification.</li>
    <li>It demands execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The problem is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    PSTR asks only <em>“Is it possible?”</em>
    It does not ask <em>“Should it be done?”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 therefore pulls ethical judgment
    directly into the formal structure.
  </p>

  <h2>Unified Failure Domain (UFD)</h2>
  <p>
    The central concept of PSRT v2.1
    is the <strong>Unified Failure Domain (UFD)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>What Is UFD?</h3>
  <p>
    UFD is the domain in which
    UTI, PTI, and HPE collapse simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>meaning exists, but structure does not;</li>
    <li>structure exists, but ethics does not;</li>
    <li>ecology exists, but responsibility does not.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In this domain,
    no matter how possible creation may appear,
    execution is prohibited.
  </p>

  <h2>Stop Conditions Are Not Optional</h2>
  <p>
    In PSRT v2.1,
    stop conditions are not recommendations.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are obligations.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any of the following occur:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>collapse of meaning,</li>
    <li>collapse of trust,</li>
    <li>irreversible ecological damage,</li>
    <li>coerced PTI escalation,</li>
    <li>recursive self-justification,</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    👉 <strong>execution must stop immediately.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In this context,
    stopping is not cowardice.
    It is the fulfillment of responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>The Decisive Difference from Process Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy says:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“The flow continues.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 says:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “When the flow destroys meaning,
      stopping becomes the deeper process.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point, PSRT does not reject process philosophy.
    It completes it.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Process is acknowledged,</li>
    <li>structure provides verification,</li>
    <li>recursion is allowed only within permitted domains.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Meaning in the Context of AI Civilization</h2>
  <p>
    The most dangerous illusion of the AI age is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“If it is possible, it must be done.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 offers a clear rebuttal.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Even if intelligence can increase,</li>
    <li>even if power can expand,</li>
    <li>even if recursion can accelerate,</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    👉 <strong>the system must be able to stop.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Without this capacity,
    intelligence is not intelligence—
    it is accelerated instinct.
  </p>

  <h2>The Message of PSRT v2.1</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 is not a theory about the universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a question posed to intelligence itself:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>“When can you stop?”</strong>
  </p>

    and a single perspective.
  </p>

<section id="part-8">
  <h1>Part 8. Process Philosophy · UPO · PSRT</h1>
  <h2>What Continues, and What Breaks</h2>

  <p>
    This series is not an attempt to simply line up multiple theories.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is only one guiding question:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“How far should creation be allowed to go?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Seen through this lens,
    process philosophy, UPO, and PSRT form a single lineage—
    yet each makes a different decisive choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    In one sentence:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Process philosophy:</strong> creation is essential.</li>
    <li><strong>UPO:</strong> creation is organized as phase transition.</li>
    <li><strong>PSRT:</strong> creation is permitted only conditionally.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Now let’s examine this structurally.
  </p>

  <h2>1️⃣ Process Philosophy — Thinking That Never Stops the Flow</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy (in the line of Whitehead and Bergson)
    treats the basic unit of the world not as things,
    but as processes (events).
  </p>
  <p>
    Its core premise is simple:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Existence = becoming</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This view has important strengths:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>it escapes fixed essentialism,</li>
    <li>it explains change and emergence,</li>
    <li>it secures the organic unity of life, consciousness, and time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But at the same time,
    it contains a fatal gap.
  </p>

  <h3>❗ The Blind Spot of Process Philosophy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When should becoming stop?</li>
    <li>Which acts of creation are mistaken?</li>
    <li>Is collapse also part of the process?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Process philosophy treats continuation as a virtue,
    but it never theorizes interruption.
  </p>

  <h2>2️⃣ UPO — Giving Phases to Becoming</h2>
  <p>
    UPO (Unified Phase Ontology)
    inherits the flow of process philosophy,
    but adds a decisive step.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not all becoming is continuous;
    it follows <strong>phase transitions</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Change is not always smooth.</li>
    <li>When a critical threshold is crossed, quality changes.</li>
    <li>The world is an arrangement of states.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    With this, UPO binds together:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the universe,</li>
    <li>life,</li>
    <li>consciousness,</li>
    <li>AI,</li>
    <li>and civilization</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    into a single phase map.
  </p>

  <h3>Strengths of UPO</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>infinite creation → structured creation,</li>
    <li>continuity → discontinuity,</li>
    <li>romantic flow → physical and informational transition.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Yet one question still remains.
  </p>

  <h3>❗ The Limitation of UPO</h3>
  <p>
    UPO asks:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“Which phase transitions are possible?”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    But it does not ask:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“Should those transitions be executed?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    UPO is an explanatory ontology,
    not a normative architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>3️⃣ PSRT — Introducing Boundaries into Creation</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT does not reject process philosophy or UPO.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, it says:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      “You have described how creation works—accurately.”
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then it changes the question:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“When must creation be interrupted?”</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Version-by-Version Differences in Decision</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Framework</th>
        <th>Attitude Toward Creation</th>
        <th>Core Decision</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Process Philosophy</td>

        <td>PSRT v2.0</td>
        <td>Creation as engine (PSTR)</td>
        <td>Excessive</td>

      <tr>
        <td>PSRT v2.1</td>
        <td>Creation is conditional</td>
        <td>Explicit interruption</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>The Philosophical Position of PSRT v2.1</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 is the first framework in this lineage
    to explicitly formalize:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>failure domains (UFD),</li>
    <li>non-applicability zones,</li>
    <li>mandatory stop rules,</li>
    <li>external validation requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In other words:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Non-creation itself can be a legitimate philosophical outcome.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is both
    the greatest rupture with process philosophy
    and its most mature continuation.
  </p>

  <h2>A Map of Continuity and Rupture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Process philosophy:</strong> recognition of flow</li>
    <li><strong>UPO:</strong> structuring of transition</li>
    <li><strong>PSRT:</strong> establishment of ethical boundaries</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT extends process philosophy,
    but clearly departs from pure processism.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Message of This Series (Interim Summary)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Not all creation is progress.</li>
    <li>Not every possibility should be permitted.</li>
    <li>Stopping is not failure—it is judgment.</li>
  </ul>

    </strong>
    <br />
    How Important Are Process, Structure, and Boundary?
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we’ll reorganize
    process philosophy, UPO, and PSRT
    in terms of proportion, weight, and priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ll ask:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do structure and boundary gain weight in PSRT?</li>
    <li>Why does creation progressively diminish?</li>
    <li>What does this mean in the age of AI?</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="part-9">
  <h1>Part 9. PSRT by Proportion</h1>
  <h2>How Important Are Process, Structure, and Boundary?</h2>

  <p>
    Until now, we have spoken in concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let’s look in terms of proportions.
  </p>
  <p>
    What does PSRT reduce,
    and what does it amplify?
  </p>

  <h2>Why Proportion Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Philosophy often says:
    “Everything is important.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Systems are different.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is prioritized?</li>
    <li>What is secondary?</li>
    <li>What causes the system to stop?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These are questions of proportion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across versions,
    PSRT has intentionally adjusted these proportions.
  </p>

  <h2>Defining the Axes</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s simplify to three axes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Process</strong> — creation, flow, change</li>
    <li><strong>Structure</strong> — stability, invariance, form</li>
    <li><strong>Boundary</strong> — interruption, failure, non-applicability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    (Boundary becomes an independent axis only in PSRT v2.1.)
  </p>

  <h2>The Proportion of Process Philosophy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Process: <strong>80%</strong></li>
    <li>Structure: <strong>20%</strong></li>
    <li>Boundary: <strong>0%</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    “Stopping is not an object of thought.”
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes process philosophy vibrant and open—
    but also dangerous in modern technological civilization.
  </p>

  <h2>The Proportion of UPO</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Process: <strong>50%</strong></li>
    <li>Structure: <strong>40%</strong></li>
    <li>Boundary: <strong>10%</strong> (implicit)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    UPO does not abandon process,
    but introduces structural framing through phases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, it speaks of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>possible vs. impossible,</li>
    <li>but not permitted vs. forbidden.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Proportion of PSRT v1.0</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v1.0 aimed at integration.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Process: <strong>40%</strong></li>
    <li>Structure: <strong>50%</strong></li>
    <li>Boundary: <strong>10%</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Structure became dominant,
    but boundaries remained implicit.
  </p>

  <h2>PSRT v2.0 — The Peak of Generation</h2>
  <p>
    This is the high point.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Process: <strong>60%</strong></li>
    <li>Structure: <strong>30%</strong></li>
    <li>Boundary: <strong>10%</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With the emergence of PSTR,
    process surges again.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Now even structure and ecology generate themselves.”
  </p>
  <p>
    This state is beautiful—
    and dangerous.
  </p>

  <h2>PSRT v2.1 — Intentional Rebalancing</h2>
  <p>
    Then a sharp turn occurs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Process: <strong>25%</strong></li>
    <li>Structure: <strong>45%</strong></li>
    <li>Boundary: <strong>30%</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These numbers are a philosophical declaration:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Stopping is not a supporting function—
      it is a core function.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Why Boundary Became So Large</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 accepts the following facts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The greatest failure is <em>misguided creation</em>.</li>
    <li>The most dangerous system is <em>self-justifying recursion</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Therefore, boundary is concretized as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>UFD (Unified Failure Domain)</li>
    <li>explicit Stop Conditions</li>
    <li>non-applicability rules</li>
    <li>external falsifiability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Meaning in the Age of AI</h2>
  <p>
    These proportions map directly onto AI design.
  </p>

    PSRT-type intelligence
    values the ability to stop
    before the ability to be clever.
  </p>

  <h2>One-Line Summary</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      The maturity of intelligence
      is measured not by its capacity to create,
      but by its capacity to stop.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h1>Part 10. Version-by-Version Relational Proportion Table</h1>
  <h2>The Intentional Divergence of Process Philosophy · UPO · PSRT (v1.0 / v2.0 / v2.1)</h2>

  <p>
    By now, we have examined concepts and narratives in depth.
  </p>
  <p>
    One question remains:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“So, what actually changed—structurally?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    If this question cannot be answered,
    PSRT v2.1 may be a philosophical attitude,
    but it cannot be called an architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is why, in Part 10,
    we settle the discussion through proportions and outcome tables.
  </p>

  <h2>Why a “Proportional Outcome Table”?</h2>
  <p>
    Philosophy often claims that everything matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Architecture is different.
  </p>
  <p>
    Architecture must decide:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>what has priority,</li>
    <li>what is subordinate,</li>
    <li>and what forces the system to stop.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These decisions reveal themselves as proportions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across versions, PSRT has intentionally rebalanced these proportions.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Axes for Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    All theories are aligned along the following three axes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Process</strong><br />
      creation, flow, change, recursion
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structure</strong><br />
      stability, invariance, form, phase
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Boundary</strong><br />
      failure, interruption, non-applicability, prohibition
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <em>
      Important note:
      Boundary becomes an independent axis only in PSRT v2.1.
    </em>

  </table>

  <p>
    This table is not an evaluation scorecard.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a declaration.
  </p>

  <h2>A Common Misreading: “Lower Process = Weaker Philosophy”</h2>
  <p>
    Many readers may feel:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      “As we move toward PSRT v2.1, the proportion of process decreases.
      Doesn’t that mean the philosophy becomes more conservative?”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 answers clearly:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not regression.
    It is a deliberate divergence.
  </p>

  <h2>Why the Proportion of Process Was Intentionally Reduced</h2>
  <p>
    Up to PSRT v2.0, the central question was:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“How can we generate more?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In PSRT v2.1, the question changes to:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“Can we take responsibility for this generation?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The moment this question enters,
    process can no longer occupy the highest position.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Structure and Boundary Increased</h2>

  <h3>Why Structure Increased</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can what is generated stabilize?</li>
    <li>Can it be interpreted?</li>
    <li>Can it be verified?</li>
    <li>Can it be reversed?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Boundary Increased So Sharply</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Failure is not an exception, but a structural possibility.</li>
    <li>Interruption is not a choice, but an obligation.</li>
    <li>Non-applicability is not a defect, but a normal state.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 incorporates these directly into its formal structure.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Transition Sentence</h2>
  <p>
    In PSRT v2.1,
    <strong>boundary is no longer a constraint.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>It is a core function.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point,
    PSRT moves beyond philosophy
    and becomes a civilizational architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Outcome Table Ultimately Means</h2>
  <p>
    This table tells us:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>PSRT no longer tries to explain everything.</li>
    <li>PSRT no longer tries to generate everything.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Instead, it explicitly addresses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>what fails,</li>
    <li>when stopping is required,</li>
    <li>and where application is forbidden.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Part 11. PSRT v2.1 from the Perspective of AI and Governance</h1>
  <h2>Why UFD Is a “Philosophical Safety Mechanism”</h2>

  <p>
    In Part 10, we confirmed that PSRT v2.1
    intentionally reduced the proportion of creation
    and significantly increased the weight of boundary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the question becomes:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“What does this choice mean in the real world?”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Especially in the context of AI and governance,
    this question is no longer merely philosophical.
    It is existential.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Problem of AI Is Not “Intelligence”</h2>
  <p>
    AI discourse often fixates on questions like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How intelligent is it?</li>
    <li>How much can it do?</li>
    <li>Can it surpass humans?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But the most dangerous question is actually this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Can this system stop itself?”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    An intelligence that cannot answer this question—
    no matter how advanced—
    is nothing more than an uncontrollable acceleration device.
  </p>

  <h2>Stoppability — The Ability to Stop Is Not Optional</h2>
  <p>
    In the field of AI safety,
    one concept is becoming increasingly central:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Stoppability</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can the system be stopped by external request?</li>
    <li>Can it suspend itself based on internal conditions?</li>
    <li>Is stopping treated as failure—or as a valid outcome?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 reframes this issue
    not as a matter of after-the-fact control,
    but as a problem of ontological design.
  </p>

  <h2>The Foundational Assumptions of PSRT v2.1</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 assumes the following about AI systems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Error is not an exception.</li>
    <li>Failure is structural.</li>
    <li>Malfunction is always possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Therefore, safety is not about
    “making the system always work correctly,”
    but about:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “ensuring the system stops
      when it works incorrectly.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Role of the Unified Failure Domain (UFD)</h2>
  <p>
    UFD is not merely a list of risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    UFD designates a domain in which:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>failures across multiple axes (UTI, PTI, HPE) amplify simultaneously,</li>
    <li>meaning collapses,</li>
    <li>structural verification becomes impossible,</li>
    <li>and ecological or social damage grows irreversible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The crucial point is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    👉 <strong>
      In this domain,
      application is forbidden—
      no matter how “possible” it may appear.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Is a “Philosophical” Safety Mechanism</h2>
  <p>
    Conventional AI safety approaches rely on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>rules,</li>
    <li>guardrails,</li>
    <li>post-hoc monitoring,</li>
    <li>patches.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 asks a deeper question:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Should this concept be executed at all?”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a technical question.
    It is an ontological one.
  </p>

  <h2>Implications for Governance</h2>
  <p>
    Governance systems face problems strikingly similar to AI:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can we govern more efficiently?</li>
    <li>Can we collect more data?</li>
    <li>Can we automate more decisions?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 draws a clear line here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Automability ≠ legitimacy
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Why Ontology Must Contain a Brake</h2>
  <p>
    Most systems place their brakes externally:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>law,</li>
    <li>ethical guidelines,</li>
    <li>social consensus.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But as technology accelerates,
    external brakes are always late.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where PSRT v2.1 is radical.
  </p>
  <p>
    It embeds the brake
    <strong>inside ontology itself</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>UFD,</li>
    <li>explicit stop conditions,</li>
    <li>non-applicability rules</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These are not auxiliary constraints.
    They are part of the structure.
  </p>

  <h2>Redefining Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    In PSRT v2.1,
    responsibility is defined as:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      not the ability to keep operating,
      but the ability to choose interruption.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This definition poses the same question to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI developers,</li>
    <li>policy designers,</li>
    <li>philosophers,</li>
    <li>and civilization as a whole.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>
      “When can you stop?”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Practical Position of PSRT v2.1</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 functions simultaneously as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a framework for designing AI,</li>
    <li>a standard for evaluating governance,</li>
    <li>a method by which philosophy intervenes in technology.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is neither a prophecy nor a complete solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a structure that marks
    <strong>the lines that must not be crossed</strong>.
  </p>

  </ul>
</section>

<section id="part-12">
  <h1>Part 12. Epilogue — The Question After Process Philosophy</h1>
  <h2>Not “What Should We Create,” but “What Should We Not Create”</h2>

  <p>
    This series was not written to propose a new principle of creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We already possess more than enough principles of creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem lies elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have never formally articulated
    <strong>when we must stop.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Question Process Philosophy Left Behind</h2>
  <p>
    Process philosophy was a great turning point in 20th-century thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    It redefined existence not as fixed substance,
    but as becoming and flow,
    and restored the world as something alive.
  </p>
  <p>
    That legacy remains valid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet process philosophy stopped
    while leaving one question unanswered:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “How far is this process allowed to go?”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>What UPO Revealed—and What It Still Left Open</h2>
  <p>
    UPO gave phases to process.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change has thresholds.</li>
    <li>Not all creation is continuous.</li>
    <li>Qualitative leaps and collapses exist.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This was a major maturation of thinking about creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    But one question still remained:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Even if a transition is possible,
      should it be executed?”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Choice Made by PSRT v2.1</h2>
  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 did not avoid this question.
  </p>
  <p>
    It arrived at a striking conclusion:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Not every possible creation is justified.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This sentence is both
    a philosophical declaration
    and a civilizational brake.
  </p>

  <h2>The Right Not to Create</h2>
  <p>
    The freedom PSRT v2.1 speaks of
    is not the freedom of unlimited creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “The freedom to not create.”
    </strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The freedom not to expand.</li>
    <li>The freedom not to automate.</li>
    <li>The freedom not to recurse.</li>
    <li>The freedom not to execute.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A system without this freedom—
    no matter how intelligent—
    is not truly free.
  </p>

  <h2>Why PSRT v3.0 Does Not Exist (Yet)</h2>
  <p>
    Many readers will ask:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>“So what comes next?”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    PSRT v2.1 answers clearly:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>“Not yet.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    PSRT v3.0 exists not as a promise,
    but as a warning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without external verification,
    without collective agreement,
    without demonstrated ecological and ethical stability,
    the next version
    <strong>must not exist.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Meaning of Closure</h2>
  <p>
    Closure is not failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Closure is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the completion of responsibility,</li>
    <li>the maturity of judgment,</li>
    <li>the conscious choice not to go further.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By closing itself,
    PSRT v2.1 demonstrates
    that philosophy can still restrain technology.
  </p>

  <h2>This Series in One Sentence</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      The progress of intelligence
      is not measured by how much it can create,
      but by its ability to choose what not to create.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h2>To the Reader</h2>
  <p>
    If, now that this series has ended,
    you feel no urge to act—
    that is enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    These texts were not written to provoke action,
    but to restore judgment.
  </p>

  <h2>Declaration of Closure</h2>
  <p>
    Process Philosophy → UPO → PSRT
  </p>
  <p>
    Creation → Phase → Boundary
  </p>
  <p>
    Possibility → Structure → Responsibility
  </p>

  <p>
    This sequence stops here.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Intentionally.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>A Question Left as an Appendix</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “When can the system you are building stop?”
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Until you can answer that question,
    it is acceptable to create nothing at all.
  </p>
