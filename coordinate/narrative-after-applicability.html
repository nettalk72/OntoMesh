<h1>I Just Walked, and Bought a Memory</h1>
<p class="meta">— An unplanned walk, and a memory that stayed</p>

    <h2>1. Let’s Just Walk</h2>

    <p>It was a weekday afternoon, and I’d taken a half day off.</p>
    <p>If I went straight home, the day felt like it would end too neatly.</p>
    <p>I didn’t have a particular destination.</p>
    <p>I had time left, and the weather was strangely fine.</p>
    <p>So, on my way home on foot, I ended up at Seoul Station.</p>
    <p>It was winter, but it didn’t feel cold.</p>
    <p>I stood there without deciding where to go,</p>
    <p>then simply went up toward Seoullo 7017.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t a conscious choice.</p>
    <p>There were stairs, people were going up,</p>
    <p>and I blended into that flow.</p>
    <p>As soon as I got up there, the cars disappeared.</p>
    <p>No traffic lights, no reason to stop.</p>
    <p>My walking pace naturally settled.</p>
    <p>I decided not to think about lunch.</p>
    <p>Not because I wasn’t hungry,</p>
    <p>but because it felt like eating something right then would break this rhythm.</p>
    <p>The reason felt vague,</p>
    <p>and it seemed right to just leave it that way.</p>
    <p>Up on Seoullo, there was nothing particularly special to see.</p>
    <p>I could see Namsan, I could see the roads,</p>
    <p>the city was moving as it always does.</p>
    <p>It felt like I was the only one who had briefly risen above it.</p>
    <p>While walking,</p>
    <p>thoughts like “What should I do today?” didn’t come up.</p>
    <p>Neither did “How far should I go?”</p>
    <p>My feet simply led to the next step.</p>
    <p>Up to that point,</p>
    <p>I didn’t think this was the beginning of a day.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t a stroll, it wasn’t exercise,</p>
    <p>and I had no intention of leaving anything behind.</p>
    <p>I had simply thought,</p>
    <p>let’s walk.</p>
    <p>And that thought</p>
    <p>lasted quite a while.</p>

    <h2>2. The Day Winter Loosened</h2>

    <p>As I walked, I realized something.</p>
    <p>That today was the warmest day of the winter.</p>
    <p>They said the temperature had risen to around 10 degrees Celsius.</p>
    <p>I heard the number later,</p>
    <p>but my body knew first.</p>
    <p>My breath came out less white,</p>
    <p>my shoulders weren’t stiff.</p>
    <p>Some people were wearing padded coats,</p>
    <p>others were in light jackets.</p>
    <p>The variety in clothing</p>
    <p>didn’t mean the weather was unclear,</p>
    <p>but that people had each decided for themselves before coming out.</p>
    <p>Maybe because of that,</p>
    <p>there were more people than expected.</p>
    <p>Up on Seoullo,</p>
    <p>the distance between walkers stayed even.</p>
    <p>No one was rushing,</p>
    <p>and there weren’t many people stopping to take photos.</p>
    <p>Everyone was walking at a similar pace.</p>
    <p>I thought,</p>
    <p>“Today must be an okay day.”</p>
    <p>There was no basis for it,</p>
    <p>but no reason to deny it either.</p>
    <p>Winter usually gives you</p>
    <p>an excuse not to go out.</p>
    <p>It’s cold, the sun sets early,</p>
    <p>there are plenty of reasons you don’t need to be outside.</p>
    <p>But that day,</p>
    <p>those excuses briefly disappeared.</p>
    <p>So people came out.</p>
    <p>Not because they had special plans,</p>
    <p>but because there was no reason not to.</p>
    <p>As I walked,</p>
    <p>and stopped being aware of the cold,</p>
    <p>my thoughts slowed down too.</p>
    <p>I didn’t try to organize anything,</p>
    <p>and I didn’t evaluate the day.</p>
    <p>There was just</p>
    <p>a lingering sense of</p>
    <p>“Right now is okay.”</p>
    <p>Looking back later,</p>
    <p>this day was the beginning.</p>
    <p>Not because I started walking,</p>
    <p>but because winter loosened for a moment,</p>
    <p>and in that gap, I loosened too.</p>
    <p>I only realized that</p>
    <p>a little later.</p>

    <h2>3. As I Walked, I Started to See People</h2>

    <p>At first, I didn’t see them.</p>
    <p>To be precise,</p>
    <p>I saw them, but didn’t recognize them.</p>
    <p>While walking, people passed by</p>
    <p>like part of the background.</p>
    <p>The backs of those walking ahead,</p>
    <p>shoulders brushing past,</p>
    <p>footsteps heard from behind.</p>
    <p>At some point,</p>
    <p>people began to come into focus.</p>
    <p>There was someone pushing a stroller,</p>
    <p>someone walking at a steady pace with earphones in.</p>
    <p>Someone was jogging lightly,</p>
    <p>someone else leaned against the railing for a moment.</p>
    <p>What they had in common was</p>
    <p>that their expressions were all similar.</p>
    <p>Faces that weren’t joyful, but weren’t tired either.</p>
    <p>Expressions without a clear destination.</p>
    <p>Then there was one person I passed by.</p>
    <p>They were holding a stopwatch,</p>
    <p>looking toward the river.</p>
    <p>Their gaze was fixed,</p>
    <p>they raised and lowered their head,</p>
    <p>counting something.</p>
    <p>It looked like they were counting birds along the river.</p>
    <p>Timing things, taking notes,</p>
    <p>checking off birds that entered a certain section one by one.</p>
    <p>They looked like a college student,</p>
    <p>but I wasn’t sure.</p>
    <p>Their bag was light,</p>
    <p>their movements careful.</p>
    <p>After I passed them,</p>
    <p>I felt something was strange.</p>
    <p>Not strange exactly,</p>
    <p>but the fact that this scene belonged to today.</p>
    <p>It was winter,</p>
    <p>a weekday afternoon,</p>
    <p>someone was counting birds,</p>
    <p>someone was pushing a stroller,</p>
    <p>and I was just walking.</p>
    <p>That combination</p>
    <p>felt strangely natural.</p>
    <p>Ah,</p>
    <p>so today is this kind of day,</p>
    <p>I thought.</p>
    <p>Not a day when something happens,</p>
    <p>but a day when people come out,</p>
    <p>each at their own pace.</p>
    <p>As I walked,</p>
    <p>it felt like the city was moving</p>
    <p>to a single rhythm.</p>
    <p>Neither fast nor slow,</p>
    <p>without forcing itself.</p>
    <p>That was when, for the first time,</p>
    <p>I thought,</p>
    <p>“I’m not the only one who came out.”</p>
    <p>This wasn’t a solitary walk,</p>
    <p>but a momentary blend into</p>
    <p>a silent collective outing.</p>
    <p>And that sensation</p>
    <p>lingered a little longer.</p>

    <h2>4. Following the Waterway</h2>

    <p>By the time I came down from Seoullo 7017,</p>
    <p>I wasn’t thinking about where I was going.</p>
    <p>There were stairs,</p>
    <p>a path continued downward,</p>
    <p>and I went down naturally.</p>
    <p>After coming down and walking for a while, I saw a sign for Cheonggyecheon.</p>
    <p>So I just went.</p>
    <p>Cheonggyecheon</p>
    <p>doesn’t ask walkers questions.</p>
    <p>“How far are you going?”</p>
    <p>“Why are you walking?”</p>
    <p>It doesn’t ask.</p>
    <p>It just</p>
    <p>continues forward.</p>
    <p>There’s a path beside the water,</p>
    <p>people beside the path,</p>
    <p>and people choose a pace and walk.</p>
    <p>You can stop,</p>
    <p>but there’s no reason to.</p>
    <p>So you keep going.</p>
    <p>As I walked,</p>
    <p>the city’s noise lowered a little.</p>
    <p>The sound of cars rose above,</p>
    <p>and below there were only footsteps and water.</p>
    <p>At this point,</p>
    <p>it would make sense to think,</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know I’d come this far,”</p>
    <p>but I didn’t.</p>
    <p>Because</p>
    <p>it didn’t feel like I had come anywhere.</p>
    <p>There was no middle.</p>
    <p>It was just continuous.</p>
    <p>I knew Cheonggyecheon connected to Jungnangcheon,</p>
    <p>but I didn’t think about it.</p>
    <p>I had the knowledge,</p>
    <p>but not the awareness.</p>
    <p>While walking,</p>
    <p>it didn’t feel like I was choosing a route.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t a choice,</p>
    <p>but a placement within a flow.</p>
    <p>That’s what waterways are like,</p>
    <p>I thought.</p>
    <p>From above,</p>
    <p>you can see where they start</p>
    <p>and where they go,</p>
    <p>but from inside,</p>
    <p>you only see what’s ahead.</p>
    <p>So the walking continued.</p>
    <p>Not because of a plan,</p>
    <p>but because there was no reason to stop.</p>
    <p>Looking back later,</p>
    <p>this might have been when it started.</p>
    <p>That the walking of this day</p>
    <p>wasn’t “a route I chose,”</p>
    <p>but me following</p>
    <p>“a route the city had already made.”</p>
    <p>That fact</p>
    <p>would only gain meaning</p>
    <p>a bit later.</p>

    <h2>5. The Name Oksu</h2>

    <p>When I arrived,</p>
    <p>I didn’t feel anything special.</p>
    <p>After passing Jungnangcheon and coming out toward the Han River,</p>
    <p>walking past Eungbong and a bit further,</p>
    <p>I saw a familiar sign.</p>
    <p>Oksu Station.</p>
    <p>A name I had always passed through by subway.</p>
    <p>A name that existed only as a sound.</p>
    <p>That day too, at first,</p>
    <p>it was nothing more than that.</p>
    <p>Just</p>
    <p>“Oh, this is here,”</p>
    <p>that level of recognition.</p>
    <p>My body had already walked quite a bit,</p>
    <p>and I thought this would be a fine place to stop.</p>
    <p>I saw a bakery café near the station,</p>
    <p>and went in without thinking.</p>
    <p>When I sat down,</p>
    <p>I didn’t bother calculating</p>
    <p>how far I had walked.</p>
    <p>What was a little strange was</p>
    <p>that I wasn’t immediately hungry.</p>
    <p>Even though it had been quite a while since I’d skipped lunch,</p>
    <p>I didn’t feel an urgent need to eat.</p>
    <p>Drinking coffee,</p>
    <p>I watched people through the glass.</p>
    <p>Everyone was moving through the station</p>
    <p>at their own pace.</p>
    <p>Then suddenly,</p>
    <p>the word “Oksu”</p>
    <p>caught in my mind.</p>
    <p>Not the sound,</p>
    <p>but the meaning came first.</p>
    <p>玉水.</p>
    <p>Jade-like water.</p>
    <p>The route of the entire day</p>
    <p>suddenly felt tied together by a single word.</p>
    <p>Cheonggyecheon,</p>
    <p>Jungnangcheon,</p>
    <p>the Han River.</p>
    <p>Following waterways,</p>
    <p>and stopping at a place named “water.”</p>
    <p>It didn’t feel profound.</p>
    <p>Rather,</p>
    <p>because it felt so natural,</p>
    <p>I smiled a little.</p>
    <p>I wondered if this was what names were like.</p>
    <p>Nothing when you pass them by,</p>
    <p>but when context appears,</p>
    <p>they suddenly find their place.</p>
    <p>The things I realized that day</p>
    <p>didn’t all gain meaning at once.</p>
    <p>Records of King Sejong,</p>
    <p>historical context,</p>
    <p>those things didn’t come to mind then.</p>
    <p>There was just one thing that was clear.</p>
    <p>From now on,</p>
    <p>I wouldn’t be able to pass this station name</p>
    <p>the same way as before.</p>
    <p>Oksu</p>
    <p>was no longer just a sound,</p>
    <p>but a meaning attached</p>
    <p>to the end of a day.</p>
    <p>That meaning</p>
    <p>wasn’t organized yet.</p>
    <p>It didn’t need to be.</p>
    <p>Just the fact that I had arrived here</p>
    <p>was enough.</p>

    <h2>6. A Late Lunch at Oksu Station</h2>

    <p>After entering the café,</p>
    <p>I drank coffee,</p>
    <p>looked out the window,</p>
    <p>and drank coffee again.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know exactly how time passed.</p>
    <p>I didn’t check the clock,</p>
    <p>and there were no notifications.</p>
    <p>I just sat there.</p>
    <p>My body slowly cooled down.</p>
    <p>The heat left my soles,</p>
    <p>my shoulders loosened again.</p>
    <p>Sensations that hadn’t been there while walking</p>
    <p>gradually returned.</p>
    <p>Only then did a signal come,</p>
    <p>not from my stomach,</p>
    <p>but from my whole body.</p>
    <p>A signal that it was okay to eat now.</p>
    <p>That’s when I realized</p>
    <p>it had been four hours</p>
    <p>since I skipped lunch.</p>
    <p>It was an ambiguous time</p>
    <p>to call it a late lunch.</p>
    <p>Still,</p>
    <p>it didn’t feel strange.</p>
    <p>It didn’t feel like releasing something I’d been holding back,</p>
    <p>but like a natural next step</p>
    <p>that came when it was needed.</p>
    <p>Even with food in front of me,</p>
    <p>I didn’t eat in a hurry.</p>
    <p>I chewed slowly,</p>
    <p>swallowed slowly.</p>
    <p>I don’t remember if the food tasted special.</p>
    <p>Just that</p>
    <p>the fact that I was eating</p>
    <p>quietly sank in.</p>
    <p>Only then did the day</p>
    <p>feel like it was completed</p>
    <p>as a single flow.</p>
    <p>Walking,</p>
    <p>sitting,</p>
    <p>eating.</p>
    <p>None of them</p>
    <p>were ahead or behind.</p>
    <p>The late lunch</p>
    <p>wasn’t a reward.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t compensation for effort.</p>
    <p>It was just</p>
    <p>a kind of permission</p>
    <p>to move on to the next thing.</p>
    <p>When I went back outside,</p>
    <p>the sky was starting to darken.</p>
    <p>The temperature was dropping too.</p>
    <p>Still,</p>
    <p>there was no need to hurry.</p>
    <p>Today had already</p>
    <p>flowed well</p>
    <p>at its own pace.</p>

    <h2>7. Days When I Sold Memories, and the Day I Bought One</h2>

    <p>In the past,</p>
    <p>there were times when I felt a strange sensation while living a day.</p>
    <p>A feeling that this scene</p>
    <p>would be used later.</p>
    <p>A premonition that these words</p>
    <p>would be taken out and said again someday.</p>
    <p>When that happened,</p>
    <p>it felt less like I was living a day,</p>
    <p>and more like I was organizing memories</p>
    <p>and handing them over somewhere.</p>
    <p>Wrapping good memories a bit more,</p>
    <p>paring down bad ones a bit.</p>
    <p>The present becoming material</p>
    <p>for future explanation.</p>
    <p>Back then,</p>
    <p>that felt natural.</p>
    <p>I thought everyone lived that way.</p>
    <p>But today,</p>
    <p>that sensation wasn’t there.</p>
    <p>While walking,</p>
    <p>I never once thought about</p>
    <p>how I would describe this later.</p>
    <p>I didn’t want to take photos,</p>
    <p>and I didn’t feel the urge to record anything.</p>
    <p>I didn’t even care</p>
    <p>whether this would remain as a memory.</p>
    <p>Because of that,</p>
    <p>this day wasn’t sold.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t delivered anywhere,</p>
    <p>and wasn’t reserved for any purpose.</p>
    <p>It simply remained</p>
    <p>as time that had been paid.</p>
    <p>Only later did I realize the difference.</p>
    <p>In the past,</p>
    <p>I was selling memories,</p>
    <p>and today,</p>
    <p>it felt like I bought one.</p>
    <p>Not with money,</p>
    <p>and not through effort.</p>
    <p>I just</p>
    <p>spent time</p>
    <p>without attaching any conditions,</p>
    <p>and that was all.</p>
    <p>Days when you sell memories,</p>
    <p>when the day ends,</p>
    <p>feel a little empty.</p>
    <p>Explanations remain,</p>
    <p>but there’s no afterimage.</p>
    <p>Days when you buy a memory,</p>
    <p>even without explanation,</p>
    <p>linger strangely.</p>
    <p>You can’t use them,</p>
    <p>but they don’t disappear either.</p>
    <p>Today</p>
    <p>was the latter.</p>
    <p>That’s why this day</p>
    <p>was stored in a form</p>
    <p>that suits my future self</p>
    <p>better than my present self.</p>

    <h2>8. My Future Self Will Remember</h2>

    <p>As I left Oksu Station,</p>
    <p>a thought suddenly crossed my mind.</p>
    <p>That every time I pass through this station in the future,</p>
    <p>my future self</p>
    <p>might remember my present self.</p>
    <p>Without trying to recall it deliberately,</p>
    <p>just</p>
    <p>as the train stops,</p>
    <p>as the doors open,</p>
    <p>in passing.</p>
    <p>“Ah,</p>
    <p>that time I just walked.”</p>
    <p>That would be enough.</p>
    <p>My present self</p>
    <p>has no plan to make use of this memory.</p>
    <p>I don’t intend to use it as comfort,</p>
    <p>or organize it into a lesson.</p>
    <p>Just</p>
    <p>the feeling that something is now there,</p>
    <p>something my future self can take out when needed.</p>
    <p>It naturally followed that</p>
    <p>the benefit wouldn’t be enjoyed by my present self,</p>
    <p>but by my future self.</p>
    <p>Thinking back on that day</p>
    <p>won’t solve problems.</p>
    <p>It won’t clarify direction.</p>
    <p>But it will probably be like this.</p>
    <p>On a hard day,</p>
    <p>on a day when I’m tired for no reason,</p>
    <p>or on a day when nothing happens at all,</p>
    <p>a fleeting scene.</p>
    <p>The stairs going up at Seoul Station,</p>
    <p>the wind on Seoullo,</p>
    <p>footsteps beside the waterway,</p>
    <p>the lights near Oksu Station.</p>
    <p>That memory</p>
    <p>doesn’t say anything,</p>
    <p>but somehow</p>
    <p>makes you a little less rushed.</p>
    <p>So my future self</p>
    <p>might feel quite grateful</p>
    <p>to my present self.</p>
    <p>“For leaving that day</p>
    <p>without forcing an explanation.”</p>
    <p>After thinking that,</p>
    <p>it felt like there was nothing more to do</p>
    <p>in this moment.</p>
    <p>As if</p>
    <p>everything that needed to be handed over</p>
    <p>already had been.</p>
    <p>My future self</p>
    <p>will take it out when needed.</p>
    <p>That was</p>
    <p>enough.</p>

    <h2>9. Unrecognized Days</h2>

    <p>When you think about it,</p>
    <p>days like this aren’t special.</p>
    <p>Everyone has them.</p>
    <p>You moved without intention,</p>
    <p>spent time without purpose,</p>
    <p>and later, when you look back,</p>
    <p>it felt strangely okay.</p>
    <p>Most of them, however,</p>
    <p>go unrecognized.</p>
    <p>They’re wedged between schedules,</p>
    <p>too ordinary,</p>
    <p>or too busy,</p>
    <p>and simply pass by.</p>
    <p>Days judged</p>
    <p>as not worth remembering.</p>
    <p>So they get sorted out</p>
    <p>before they ever become memories.</p>
    <p>People often look for the reason life feels hard</p>
    <p>in big events,</p>
    <p>but in reality,</p>
    <p>the fact that days like these go unrecognized</p>
    <p>has a greater impact.</p>
    <p>Not because there were no okay moments,</p>
    <p>but because they existed</p>
    <p>and weren’t held onto.</p>
    <p>Unrecognized days</p>
    <p>don’t become comfort.</p>
    <p>They don’t remain as evidence.</p>
    <p>So when hard days come,</p>
    <p>the illusion that</p>
    <p>“I was always struggling”</p>
    <p>quietly hardens.</p>
    <p>But in truth,</p>
    <p>in between,</p>
    <p>there were definitely times</p>
    <p>when nothing was wrong.</p>
    <p>We just didn’t notice them.</p>
    <p>What was different about today</p>
    <p>was just one thing.</p>
    <p>That this day</p>
    <p>was recognized.</p>
    <p>Not by attaching meaning,</p>
    <p>not by giving it a name,</p>
    <p>but simply being able to say,</p>
    <p>“Ah, there was a day like this.”</p>
    <p>That alone</p>
    <p>was enough.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to live every day like this.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to notice every time.</p>
    <p>Just,</p>
    <p>not forgetting that there were days like this,</p>
    <p>even occasionally.</p>
    <p>That alone</p>
    <p>makes life</p>
    <p>a little less harsh.</p>

    <h2>10. That Day Existed</h2>

    <p>I won’t say I learned something from this day.</p>
    <p>It’s hard to say there was any realization.</p>
    <p>The day simply passed,</p>
    <p>I walked,</p>
    <p>and I stopped at a station.</p>
    <p>That’s all.</p>
    <p>I don’t know</p>
    <p>whether I’ll recall this day again.</p>
    <p>It might be often,</p>
    <p>or hardly at all.</p>
    <p>But</p>
    <p>it doesn’t seem like it will disappear.</p>
    <p>This day</p>
    <p>wasn’t organized,</p>
    <p>wasn’t bound into meaning,</p>
    <p>and wasn’t submitted anywhere.</p>
    <p>That’s why</p>
    <p>it remains intact.</p>
    <p>A day that started at Seoul Station,</p>
    <p>walked through Seoullo,</p>
    <p>followed the waterways down,</p>
    <p>and stopped at Oksu Station.</p>
    <p>Explained plainly,</p>
    <p>it’s a simple route.</p>
    <p>No special events,</p>
    <p>nothing to boast about.</p>
    <p>And yet,</p>
    <p>strangely,</p>
    <p>it doesn’t vanish.</p>
    <p>Probably</p>
    <p>because there was no intention.</p>
    <p>I didn’t try to leave anything behind,</p>
    <p>and I didn’t try to use memory.</p>
    <p>I simply</p>
    <p>lived.</p>
    <p>That’s why this day</p>
    <p>will continue,</p>
    <p>from time to time,</p>
    <p>to surface without warning.</p>
    <p>When a subway stops,</p>
    <p>when a station name is heard,</p>
    <p>on days with similar temperatures.</p>
    <p>Each time,</p>
    <p>it doesn’t need to feel big.</p>
    <p>A brief passing is enough.</p>
    <p>“Ah,</p>
    <p>that day existed.”</p>
    <p>With just that one sentence,</p>
    <p>this day fulfills its role.</p>
    <p>Not every day</p>
    <p>needs to be meaningful.</p>
    <p>It’s okay if there’s at least one day</p>
    <p>that didn’t demand meaning.</p>
    <p>That day</p>
    <p>was one of those days.</p>
